            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOme weekes since there was sent unto mee, from a worthy Gentleman (a friend of mine) a Tract in writing, of somewhat a distracted subject, method, and expression, without any Authors name unto it. Though I could not then be so confident, that Master <hi>Walker</hi> was the Authour, as I then was, (and still am) that the opinion (whatsoever it be) that seekes maintenance in it, but findes none, is a supine &amp; fond errour (I forbeare to call it Heresie, Blasphemie, or the like, lest my Antagonist knowing so well my ignorance in Rhetoricke, should boast, that I was beholding to him for his) yet had I a very reasonable and strong perswasion, that he was the man, and no other. And this I was induced to beleeve, the rather (besides divers other grounds of this apprehension) because I finde the image and character of the man, so fairely and significantly stamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, viz. words, and passion. <hi>Nec lac lacti, nec ovo ovum simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius: vnum qui nôrit, ambos noverit.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Not milke to milke, nor egg to egg more like,</l>
               <l>Then booke to man, and man againe to booke.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Some monethes before, upon the clamorous, uncessant, and insulting importunity of some, who were confident (it seemes) of finding shelter under M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">s</seg>. wing for some opinions they held and loved dearely (though they little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it) and would not trust so bad a cause in the hand of any other Champion (their owne word and stile they gave him) I was requested and much pressed from time to time by some of my acquaintance, that if I could at any time spare a day, I would goe over to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> to consider and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49424:4"/> some points, depending (as it seemed) in sharpe dispute among themselves. Why M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> amongst all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in Citie or Countrey, should be so importunely pitched upon by those men, I leave to those that know him, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: onely thus farre (as I was informed) they discovered themselves, that they little thought or expected, I either would or durst looke such a champion as he in the face. In which conceipt of my unwillingnesse &amp; fearefulnesse to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe was partaker with them, and lost a wager of fiveshillings (as himselfe consessed) upon it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeares, that these men had such an opinion or hope of him, that there was some knowne propertie in him, which should make sober men and of few words afraid to come neere him in a way of disputation; which whether it bee the depth of his learning, the sharpenesse of his wit, activenesse in disputing, or some other thing, I will not divine, but had rather others should conjecture, then I determine. At last (not without much gainesaying from my other occasions and imployments) I sacrificed a day upon the service of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>W</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">s</seg>. reputation, and went to him▪ to conferre with him about the points in question betweene his friends and mine, and to receive further information from him therein, if hee had had any of this commodity in his hand. But my going to him was upon the same termes, and with like successe that Christ went to the figtree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. who found no fruit thereon, but leaves onely. The conference betweene us being mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a tumultuous and issuelesse manner, the one of us still carrying aside the state of the Question, and hiding it in a great thicket and wildernesse of words, and no waies willing to heare or understand, what the opinion was, wherein sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction was desired: I was desired at last, both by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">s</seg>. owne brother, (the Minister of the place, in whose house wee were) and by divers others unknowne to me then present (well-willers, as I conceived, both to peace and truth) to leave something in writing, whereby the state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or controversie betweene us, might be the more steadily and distinctly knowne and judged of. The day being farre spent, and opportunity otherwise wanting for setting downe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49424:4"/> then in writing, what I judged convenient and necessary for such a purpose, and having casually about me a paper of some collections I had formerly made concerning the interpretatiō of such passages in the fourth chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the businesse betweene us, this I left behind me, with a faire and ingenuous promise and protestation, that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> or any other, could give me a distinct and cleare accompt, how those passages might with any tollerable congruity of reason and consistence with other Scriptures of like argument, bee carried in their interpretation, to comply with the opinion held by some against me; I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge any such satisfaction, and let my present judgement and opinion fall. Therefore whereas M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines page 27. of his discourse (as of some injurie done to him, or affront put upon him) that hee should bee challenged to answer those reasons I left with him, I dare not absolutely deny, himselfe affirming it, but that hee might bee challenged (least ignorance, impudence, lying, heresie, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and such furies, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">s</seg>. familiars, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be about my eares for it) but this I confidently affirme (yet without any impudence at all) that if M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> were so challenged, it was by him, who long fince appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Samuells</hi> likenesse, and of late (it seemes) hath appeared to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> and given him this challenge. Those few notes I left with him, have proved very fruitfull and generative: they are returned into my bosome with an abundant increase. Yet unhappy they have been in their propagation: they have not begotten in their image or likenesse. I doe not remember that any one line amongst them was possessed with any such tragicall, truculent or Gorgonean spirit, as breathes fire &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in a great part of that long discourse occasioned by them. Why M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> should write so much upon so small an occasion, I impute to the abundance of his time and leasure above mine, who may (I conceive) drop weekes and moneths against my houres, in the fulnesse of an estate temperance (we know) is more then an ordinary vertue. Why he should write so much to so little purpose, I am loath to impute to any infirmitie or defect in him, whereby he should be disabled
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49424:5"/> from discerning, when either himselfe or others, speake shells, or kernells: I will rather impute it to some such politique and profound reach in him as this; knowing my leasure to be little to attend such eccentricall &amp; by-businesse as this is, his device might be to oppresse and overcharge my time with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that so I might be straightned, if not wholly cut off from answering. And the truth is, that the bulkinesse or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the discourse, is the life and soule of it, it being more troublesome to reade, then to answer. But what should so transcendently sublimate the choler of the man, to raile right downe such milstones of obloquies, reproches, calumnies, curses upon my head, I cannot imagine; except it were the fairenesse of my writing, and fewnesse of my words when I was with him: both which having an energeticall and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant antipathy to an angry temper, and talking disposition, might (I confesse) by way of an antiperistasis, provoke and inflame their contrary natures in him. Other cause (besides these) on my part, I verily know none, except (happily) that also might be a sparke falling into his gunpowder, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him once and againe, when we were together, that hee would clearely and distinctly lay downe, what his opinion was, in opposition to what was maintained by me. Himselfe indeede, in the presence of some both of his friends and mine, (who were partly requested, and partly offered themselves to goe over to him, to mediate with him for a peace, or at lest for termes of a fairer warre, after he had begunne the fight in this furious manner) drew the pedegree and royall descent of his quarrell against me, from an ancient meeting betweene us in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> some three or foure yeares since (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I know not how long before any thing was thought of concerning the dispute now depending) at which meeting (as the partie aggrieved in effect complaineth) I did not doe my homage to his discourse with that reverence and gravity which became me, but either smiled or laughed at it; I am not conscious to my self of any such prodigious oversight, but since I was challenged for it▪ I have enquired after my error by as many as I have met with, of those that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us, and can heare no tydings of it at any hand.

But I feare, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> had rather take revenge, then satisfaction: and by his owne confession of the roote and originall of his quarrell against me, it may easily be perceived, how good and faithfull a treasurer he is of the black Princes coyne; these three or foure yeares together he hath sat brooding a Cockatrice egge, and now at last the fiery flying Serpent is come forth. But this by the way. At my late being with him about the point in Question, in stead of cleering his opinion, when he was desired and pressed thereunto, he still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed a dark cloud of words, and quite buried his minde under his tongue. And when wee should have met about our businesse in the East, and were upon the point of grapling and closing, he immediately hoyseth up sayle, and tacks about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the West, as if he had been affrighted with his owne opinion or shadow, and had resolved never to come neere it. And to this day, what his opinion cleerly is in opposition to me in this controversie, I am at perfect peace in my thoughts, that himselfe yet understandeth not. I have this ground (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) for what I say, because a man may as well find a needle in a bottle of hay, as finde any such opinion, either cleered, or constantly maintained, in this his discourse, which yet was penned by him purposely in confutation of my (er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously so called) errour. Surely his opinion, (what ever it be) is very melancholique, and (according to the character of that humour) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I will first tell you, what I call the backside of his opinion: and then what I meane by the fore-side, or face. The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of his opinion, I call those generall, lax, and wide expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, wherein (and wherein onely) he expresseth himselfe in his discourse, as, <hi>viz.</hi> That Beleevers have communion with Christ; That Faith is not our Righteousnesse; that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and satisfaction of Christ are imputed to us; that we are justified by Christs righteousnesse, and such like. In which positions, if his meaning be no worse then his words, (though some of them be incommodious, &amp; of no affinitie with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expressions in this point) I neither ever was, nor yet am, nor (I hope) ever shall be an adversary to him. I call these the backside of his opinion, because they doe onely in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, confused, and indistinct manner represent his judgement in this controversie, and upon such termes, that a man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily carry away his words, and yet leave his opinion behind him, as it is an easie matter to mistake one man for another, when their backs onely are toward us. But 2<seg rend="sup">o</seg>, if Master <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> had any mind to shew us the face of his opinion, he should tell us distinctly, roundly, and plainly, what righteousnesse of Christ he means should be imputed to us for righteousnesse, and how, and after what manner, and upon what termes it is imputed, as <hi>viz.</hi> Whether by vertue of such imputation, a man be made legally righteous, so that he may claime Heaven in right of the first Covenant, <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> or whither, by Christs righteousnesse imputed to us, he meanes nothing else, but our being justified by the vertue or merit of those things, which Christ hath done and suffered for us? He that doth not in this controversie, punctually, and precisely explaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in these particulars, rather conceales and covers, then discovers his opinion. If M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>W.</hi> at any time seemes to make some slender explication of himselfe in some of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, he soone misfigures againe his owne expression with words of manifest inconsistency therewith: so that the setled judgement of the Author in the Question controverted, must be some where else inquired after, then in his discourse: This I can say of mine own knowledge, that when I was with him, pressing him to know, whither by the righteousnesse of Christ
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49424:6"/> (in his opinion) he meant the righteousnesse of his nature, consisting of inward habits or dispositions of grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; or the righteousnesse of his life, consisting of those righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous acts, which he performed in obedience to the Law of God, or whither he included them both, he absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that he meant either the one or the other, or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The same deniall, I heard, he had formerly made to another (who put the same, or like question to him) with some ill language uttered against me, that I should goe about to perswade my followers, that either he or any other of his judgement in this question, should so conceive. Being further pressed to declare himselfe, whither his meaning then was, that any such righteousnesse of Christ were imputed to us, which Christ himselfe never had (no other righteousnesse of Christ, either as man, or Mediator, being imaginable but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the two former) here he brake off with some such shuffling expression as this, that he held, it was a humane righteousnesse that was imputed from Christ unto us, and would heare no more on that eare. If any man out of all this, and ten times more in his discourse to helpe him, can make out the riddle of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>W</hi>
               <seg rend="sup">s</seg>. opinion, I doe not envie him the mystery of his knowledge: but for my part (whither it be my ignorance in Logique, or in Rhetorique, I cannot tell) my soule cannot find the way to enter into his secret. The best that I can make of his opinion, from his words and writings together, is this; that that Righteousnesse of Christ, which was none of Christs righteousnesse, is imputed to us for our righteousnesse, in our justification. Which conclusion if he can fetch off roundly, and like a man, from the Scriptures, I presently yeeld him the Bucklers, and will be no longer his corrivall—<hi>Sed Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida solus habebit:</hi> that is, <hi>He shall faire Phillis have alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deny not, but some may possibly be convinc'd and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his discourse: but certainly, they must be such as stand in a precipitate and headlong disposition to his opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand. I professe, I scarce ever met with any man, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so weake and contemptible in his premisses, fell so sore and heavy in his conclusions.

But the truth, neither desireth nor needeth any goods so ill gotten. What depths of learning, wit or judgement, men of more raised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and sublimated apprehensions may finde, in that boysterous, unchristian, and inhumane Dialect, meeter for the disputes of <hi>Jjm</hi> and <hi>Oijm,</hi> then for theirs that call themselves the Ministers of Jesus Christ, wherein his discourse is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I know not: neither doe I desire to damnifie or prejudice M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> in any part of his reputation with such men. But for my selfe, I looke and looke as narrowly, as unpartially as I can, and yet can find no depths in such learning, but onely the depths of <hi>Machiavell.</hi> Indeed his beloved Maxime, in case of opposition was; <hi>Calumniare audacter, aliquid haerebit,</hi> that is, Calumniate thy adversary stoutly; something will stick by him in despite of him, let him doe what he can to wipe it off.

            <p>When I left my papers with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> I was in hope, that I had put my selfe into the hand of a Minister of Jesus Christ, which though I dare not yet denie him to be, yet in the favourablest construction that can bee made of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, he is one of the strangest Ministers of Christ that a man shall lightly heare of. That a Minister of Satan should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himselfe into an Angell of light (as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh) holds a rationall proportion and consistence, both with the shame and reproach of sinne, and with the glory of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: neither is it much to bee marvelled at, that men should seeke to hide deformitie under an appearance of lovelinesse and beauty. But that a Minister of Christ should transforme himselfe into the likenesse of an Angel of darkenesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeare the brightnesse of his face with the grease and soote of hell, is the most unnaturall metamorphosis that ever was heard of.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell disputed with the Devill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> hee durst not bring against him a railing accusation. <hi>Jude</hi> verse 9. Therefore (doubtlesse) M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> must either make himselfe greater then the <hi>Archangel,</hi> or me worse then the Devill, or both; or else he hath foulely miscarried in a great and weighty duty of Christianity. It may be he can deliver himselfe roundly without any scruple of conscience, out of these straights: it is but thrusting mee downe a degree beneath Lucifer, and then his mouth is wiped cleane, he hath done nothing. God forbid that I should up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid any man with his sufferings: God and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> and some other good enemie-friends, have put me (of late) into the liverie of the company of sufferers; but I see that it was not the crosse that <hi>Dysmas</hi> (if that was his name) hung on, that brought him to repentance, but hee that was crucified with him. And <hi>Cyprian</hi> reports of some that had suffered, who grew worse and more insolent afterwards.</p>

            <p>If M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> had an intent or desire to have gained ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, or led me away in triumph, hee was quite mistaken in the method of his warre. Five sober words well ballanced with reason and understanding, would have gone further with me, and wounded me deeper then a thousand crackers, or the raging, reasonlesse, roarings of ten thousand Belzeebubs. I regard no more the rage or rubbidge of any mans tongue, (though in many degrees of outward greatnesse and power, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W<seg rend="sup">s</seg>.</hi> superiour) then I doe the dung that passeth from him. But if any man speakes reason (though he bee as many degrees his inferiour) I am ready to tremble, and to doe him reverence. Therefore M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> might have kept his earth-quakes and whirlewinds and fires, and sold them for bugbeares to scare children: his still voyce would soone have layed mee at his feet. I dare not (indeede) deale with him, or answer him at his owne weapon (I meane railing) how ever provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: the yoke that Christ hath put about my necke to keepe me in compasse this way, I dare not breake nor cast from mee. Neither doe I know any example in all the Historie of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that would beare mee out in such a practise And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heare promise him (and will keepe promise too, for his learning) that throughout all my Reply, I will neither call him Socinian, nor Arminian, nor Hereticke, nor Blasphemer, nor Lyer, nor lying Sophister, nor Impudent fellow, or the like. It may be I may now and then (but very rarely) admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the infusion of some of these simples, but will never give the grosse substance I shall deale with him in a more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous way. I hope, that having taken a liberty in folio to speake evill of me undeservedly, hee will not be a man of so hard a conscience, as not to give me leave in <hi>decimo sexto</hi> to make merry with him.

            <p>I thought it the safer way, and wherein the truth might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer lesse, to be somewhat larger, and to give the world a tast of his deepe non-sight in the Question under dispute, and of his truth and faithfulnesse in these proceedings.

Yet in this I can partly excuse him: for being naturally a sub-angry man, it is like that his promise and hee fell out by the way, and were at odds, and so could not walke together to their journeyes end.</p>
            <p>For my method in transacting this businesse with him, I shall not strike, as oft as I finde him naked: I should then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharge my Reader, with inke and paper, (whatsoever I have done now) which is a pressure I have sufferd my selfe under him. I may cover a multitude of infirmities, and yet have sufficient to worke upon besides. I shall onely here and there, where the occasion is the ranker, apply some ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions: yet so, that the Reader shall finde, every thing that deserves an answer (yea, and many things, which indeede deserved it not) fully sifted and examined. In these my ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions, I still make reference (in the margin) to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall passages of that copie of his Answer, which was sent unto mee, for the finding out those passages, to which I doe more particularly frame my reply. And were it not for labour or charge of writing, I could wish that hee that shall please to peruse these notes and observations upon his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, might have a copy of the Answer it selfe by him, to read (occasionally) the entire passages of things there, which I was loath to transcribe at large in my reply. Notwithstanding to save my Reader that labour and charge, without any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all losse or damage of the matters betweene us, I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed many things <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the answer, from place to place; which makes my Reply so much the more bulkie▪ and overladen with words.</p>
            <p>Vpon the receipt of his Answer, before I proceeded in this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49424:9"/> Reply, I wrote a letter to him by some of my friends, partly to know the certaintie concerning the Answer, whether he would owne it, or no: partly to give him a friendly oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and intimation of making cleane where he had fouled therein (I meane of retracting his foule and unseemely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) before my pen came to tread in it, and so to make it stinck to his shame and infamie in the world. The copie of which letter I have here transcribed immediately after this preface. But as <hi>David</hi> complained of his enemies, that they rewarded him evill for good, to the spoyling of his soule, <hi>Psalme</hi> 35. so my severe and implacable adversarie, Mesech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, when I was for peace, he was for warre: and in stead of the least relenting of his discrologie, or any waies compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with my motion that way, he entertayned the Messenger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

My desire and intent is, rather to make merry with my Antagonist, then to complie with him in his passion, or to be angry, because he is angry: yet I know not, whether it may not bee the greater rack and torture to him, to bee put to it to be angry alone.</p>
            <p>The great God of Heaven and earth, by whom I must bee judged (and that I know not how soone or suddenly) as well concerning my carriage in this businesse, as the other acts of my life, knoweth that I stand cleare and free in my heart and spirit to the man (notwithstanding his seven fold provocation) wishing him no more evill, then I doe to my selfe, or my own soule, and am ready at an houre, upon the acknowledgement of his oversight, to give him the right hand of fellowship at any time. Onely having wronged the truth (as hee hath done) it cannot be but such injuries will be chargeable to him: howsoever, Repentance will bring him into his owne againe, with advantage.</p>

            <head>The Copie of my Letter sent to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Walker,</hi> upon the Receipt of his Answer, seeking either peace from him, or a faire warre.</head>
            <p>SIR, a few dayes since there was sent unto me, from a Gentleman (a Friend and Neighbour of mine) a Manuscript of about 21 leaves in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which though I have not yet had time (by reason of full imployments otherwise) fully to peruse, yet casting my eye here and there, by some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I conjecture the piece to be yours. Wherein also I am somewhat the further confirmed, by the common rumor abroad in the Citie, and which came to my eares severall weeks, before I Received the Writing, that your Answer to my Reasons, were in the hands of many. Yet two things there are, that make me at some stand in my thoughts, whither the discourse be yours, or no; at least, whither it be come to me, as it came from you; or whither rather it be not some Libell, wherein both you and my selfe may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused together. The one is, because there is no name at all of any Author put to it▪ which (you know) is Libell-like. The other is, the many veins of unsavoury and foule lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which run here and there through the body of the Discourse. If the piece be yours, I cannot but suspect, that your Scribe, to whom you committed the transcribing of it, hath some wayes wronged you, by mingling your milk with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49424:10"/> blood, and defacing your intellectualls, with his patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls. It will not readily enter into me, that so uneven and course a thrid should be of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Walkers</hi> spinning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my request in love to you is, that you will please to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, either by writing or otherwise; whither the discourse be yours, or no, whole and intire, good and bad together, as it came to my hands: or whither onely that which is somewhat rationall and Christian in it, be yours: but for the rough Turkie dialect, as, Socinian, Arminian, lyar, lying Sophister, impudent fellow, Heretique, Blasphemer, a man of a Satanicall spirit, <hi>cum id genus monstris,</hi> you are willing to disavow. Because, that if there be a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that for the truths sake, I must have warres with you, I desire they may be Christian and fayre, such as may tend to establish and settle the truth in peace, with as little blood-shed of the names and reputations of the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as may be. Thus desiring you to send me backe the Paper I left in your hands, with the tender of my respects and love unto you, I recommend you to the grace and love of God in his Christ.</p>

But they that made and <hi>worshipped the Golden Calfe,</hi> honoured it and styled it with the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>God, These are thy Gods, O Israel &amp;c.</hi> So is it not much to be wondered at, if MR. <hi>Walker,</hi> having made and taken unto himselfe the figure of a false <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> doth the best be can to honour and grace it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world▪ with the rich Style of <hi>The true sence and meaning &amp;c.</hi> There was never any man that went about to adulterate the Kings <hi>Coyne,</hi> and to put off <hi>copper</hi> for <hi>Gold,</hi> but carefully provided for that, that <hi>Carolus Rex Dei gratia &amp;c.</hi> should be stamped in as faire a <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> upon it, as is to be found upon any piece comming out of the Kings <hi>Mint.</hi>

            <p>But the mans heart presently begins to fall under the greatnesse of his <hi>enterprise:</hi> in the very first clause of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> he abates much of his confidence in the title. For that which was there, <hi>the true sence and meaning of the Apostle</hi> (simply) is here only <hi>The true sence</hi> with limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the <hi>Common judgement of the most godly, learned, and judicious Divines, of the best Reformed Churches, &amp;c.</hi> Now wee know that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is (and oftner may bee then we are aware of) as great a difference betweene <hi>the true sence and meaning of a Scripture,</hi> and the judgement of the most godly, and <hi>learned Divines,</hi> as is betweene Heaven and Earth, yea the judgement of the most godly, learned, and <hi>judicious Divines,</hi> hath sometimes stood at that distance from <hi>the true sence and meaning</hi> of some <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that they have rejected the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves, upon a conceit that they contayned things in them contrary to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and apprehensions. This heavy censure, that notable and rare piece of <hi>Divine inspiration,</hi> the Booke of the <hi>Revelation</hi> suffered, even from the most godly, and <hi>learned Divines</hi> the Church of <hi>God</hi> had in it about the second or third <hi>Century</hi> after <hi>Christ,</hi> being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disclaimed as <hi>Apocryphall</hi> and irreptitious▪ It were easie to cite instances in abundance of great variance, and dissention betweene the judgments of <hi>Divines,</hi> of <hi>Master Walkers</hi> qualification, <hi>and the true sence and meaning of many Scriptures:</hi> and yet hee that saith and knoweth all this, may reverence the uniforme judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such <hi>Divines,</hi> touching the <hi>sence of Scriptures,</hi> as much (or more) then <hi>Master Walker</hi> himselfe doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well:</hi> but yet he bewrayeth some consciousnes, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morousnes in his undertaking, though thus qualified and explained. He doth not loosely say, that <hi>the sence</hi> of these <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which he undertakes to defend, is the sence given <hi>by most Godly Divines,</hi> but with caution upon caution, thus: <hi>accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng</hi> to the <hi>common iudgement of the most godly, and of the best Reformed Churches.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49424:12"/> by <hi>the most godly, learned, and iudicious Divines,</hi> he meanes the greater part, or number of <hi>Divines</hi> that are godly, learned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whether onely those that are most eminent amongst and above their Fellowes, <hi>for godlines, learning, &amp;c.</hi> he wisely leaves unexplained: that in case the one sence should oppresse him, he might make the other his friend to releive him. If hee desires to be understood in the former sence (which is the more honest, obvious, and direct of the two) then I feare he will be as hardly put to it for <hi>voyces</hi> amongst <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Divines,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> was in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and must take some such course to make <hi>Authors,</hi> as he did <hi>Bishops. As for Luther, Calvin, Musculus, Bullinger &amp;c.</hi> They will not come over to him with his whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: except (haply) he hath a secret pack of <hi>Authors,</hi> of the same Names, but of different judgements, with those that are commonly knowne by their <hi>Names,</hi> in the World. And it should seeme (indeed) he hath some such unknowne advantage, for <hi>page</hi> 50. hee citeth wordes out of <hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> which in my exemplar are not to be found in the place cited. And <hi>p</hi> 41. he tels a tale out of St. <hi>Bernard's 190. Epistle</hi> concerning one <hi>Peter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilaird</hi> (as his <hi>Scribe</hi> nameth him) which I beleeve is not to be found in that <hi>Epistle,</hi> except it be in his own Book. If the latter sence should be intended by him (which yeelds the best shadow for him to shelter himself under) it will be hard (I confesse) to evict him in this; because it must then first be decided (which will never be but by a generall <hi>Councell,</hi> and yet <hi>I</hi> thinke as soone without it, as with it) which, or who in all that great retinue and <hi>equipage</hi> of <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> have the preheminence above all their fellowes, in all those three incomparable qualifications, <hi>Godlinesse, learning, Judgement.</hi> For as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith well. <hi>Non est admirationi una arbor, ubi to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Nemus in eandem altitudinem surrexit.</hi> And except there be some one or more amongst them, who is more excellent then all his Neighbours, in all the three rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49424:13"/> specified (which is most unlikely: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies commonly walke single, and not by troupes, or companies, in the World) then hath <hi>Master Walker</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken nothing at all, concerning the judgement of <hi>Reformed Divines</hi> according with him, in the <hi>sence</hi> he gives of these <hi>Scriptures.</hi> But howsoever, hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe begins betimes to stumble at that <hi>Stone,</hi> (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes he chides me very sharply for stumbling at, though it be onely in his apprehension, and I make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether even there also) <hi>viz. Ambiguities in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> and I would be loath to trouble my selfe with taking him up every time, he falls on this hand, in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Sure <hi>I am</hi> (whether it be my example, or his own, he followes so close, I know not) that he speakes little better then <hi>ambiguously</hi> in the greatest part of this tract: except it be where either he speakes manifest untruths, or good common sence, instead of reason. As immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, when he speakes of the <hi>most Godly, Learned, and indicious Divines of the best Reformed Churches,</hi> what <hi>Heyfer</hi> should a man plough with to find out his <hi>riddle</hi> in those wordes, <hi>the best Reformed Churches?</hi> who knowes in what order and Method the <hi>Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are mustered and ranged in Mr. <hi>Wal.</hi> Booke of valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Churches? Quas quibus anteferat.</hi> Suppose we may probably conceive that hee takes the <hi>Reformed Church of England,</hi> for one of the best of these <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> may we not as well cast lots, as conceive otherwise, to which of the other <hi>Churches,</hi> he will give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of sitting at the right hand of the <hi>English?</hi> whether to the <hi>German, French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch Churches,</hi> or some other?</p>
            <p>Besides, if hee should particularly declare himselfe, what and how many <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> he meanes, by the best: yet wee are little the neerer, knowing his mind concerning the <hi>Divines,</hi> whose judgements hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to associate with his owne, in the sence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these <hi>Scriptures. The best Reformed Churches</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49424:13"/> have not necessarily the <hi>most godly, learned, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divines</hi> in them. The sweetest showers may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall upon the rocks: and <hi>God</hi> is at liberty to blesse weaker and lower instruments, above the increase of those, that are more excellent and glorious. Therefore all this while no man can comprehend by what he hath said, what <hi>Divines</hi> should bee of his judgement in the <hi>interpretation</hi> of these passages: neither have wee any such cause to complaine, that wee are kept in <hi>suspense</hi> herein, because (as the saying is) <hi>nihil dat quod non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> that is, <hi>nothing gives,</hi> but what it haves: it is good manners for us to be served after himselfe. I beleeve he hath no great assurance himselfe of any in this kind. When his confidence this way comes to him, I doubt not but we shall have it good cheap.</p>
            <p>But what is the <hi>sence and meaning</hi> of these places, for the <hi>defence</hi> whereof he hath taken such hold of <hi>shield</hi> and <hi>buckler?</hi> I confesse he layes downe discourse enough to open seven mens mindes at once, in as much as the <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of these <hi>Scriptures</hi> comes to. But (whether it be my dulnesse or ignorance in his <hi>Rhetorick and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> whereof I am taxed sharply enough, and it may be, deservedly enough too, <hi>page</hi> 28. and <hi>page</hi> 37. of his answer) I have no skill of his <hi>Vlyssean Eloquence,</hi> when he powreth out words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as thick as flakes of <hi>snow</hi> in <hi>Winter</hi> time; they make me as blind, as the Snow it selfe doth, when I travell in it. I cannot find out his <hi>Mole-hill</hi> of meaning for his Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of words. If all that he delivers in that <hi>multilineary Hyperbaton,</hi> be that <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> which hee hath taken into his protection, surely I neither was, nor am his adversary, in farre the greatest part of it. So that for the <hi>true sence and meaning</hi> of the place, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the defence thereof, so (I confesse) in some sence, he hath well and sufficiently performed. As <hi>Venus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and defended her son <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when she put him into a cloud, where none could see him: so hath Mr.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49424:14"/>
               <hi>W.</hi> abundantly provided for the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>true sence</hi> of these <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that no man shall be able to finde it, or come at it to doe it any harme, by spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a thick and darke <hi>cloud</hi> of words round about it on every side, Surely he hath found the <hi>line</hi> and <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> which the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> used <hi>in laying the corner stone</hi> of their Tower, and hath stretched it upon the foundation of this his <hi>Fabrick.</hi> Onely whereas (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this 2. <hi>page</hi>) he acknowledgeth and granteth, that upon <hi>Abrahams beleefe</hi> of the promise, <hi>God counted this unto him for righteousnesse;</hi> that is, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accounted him for a <hi>righteous</hi> man: if he would not afterwards misuse his owne good wordes, with a bad meaning, for my part I should never say that black was his eye, in this Question. But this is frequently observed in men that are ingaged against the <hi>truth,</hi> that the truth sometimes will be too hard for them, and breake <hi>Prison</hi> before their keepers are aware of it. I passe by other things in this page, that well deserve <hi>virgulam Censoriam,</hi> my discourse will live and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it selfe sufficiently, upon the tithes of Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, if they were but truely payd.</p>

So Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> intent in his necromanticall bringing up the dead Corpes of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> so often upon his <hi>Stage,</hi> is to bind mee hard, first to the one, and then to the other: and in this posture to drag me up and downe at his pleasure, that so by this unnaturall, and artificiall torment and shame, <hi>I might goe downe with sorrow into my grave.</hi> But the best is, he can find onely greene withs to bind mee withall, which will snap in sunder like a threed of tow, when it toucheth the fire: I have a sharpe knife about mee, called truth, that will presently deliver me out of these bands <hi>by cutting in sunder those cords of vanity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with my enemy hath bound me.</hi> And if I tooke any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in troubling my selfe that way, wherein my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary (it seemes) takes singular delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I could stretch his opinions in this <hi>controversie,</hi> upon <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> tenter-hookes, better cheap, and with lesse streyning by farre, then hee either doth or can doe mine. Yea I shall anon present you <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> himselfe, with his mouth as full of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> opinion in the point of <hi>Imputation,</hi> as it can hold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spilling. Yea (that which is yet more) if I sought any such bloudy revenge upon the man, I make no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but I could with the full leave and consent of his opinion, make him hold up his hand at the barre, and answer for those crimes of <hi>heresie</hi> and <hi>blasphemy,</hi> where &amp; for which he hath so oft arraigned me, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and cleerest reluctancy of my opinions. But if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will be content to be the <hi>erratique,</hi> I shall be content to abate him the <hi>Heretique,</hi> in the bargaine, though I might very lawfully demand it.</p>
            <p>But first let me aske Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (for I confesse I am to seeke and altogether ignorant in this poynt, if all that hee seemes to imply, be Gospell) what if it should bee granted, that both <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Socinuss,</hi> were of the same judgement with me, in the interpretation of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in Question? Is it either <hi>heresie</hi> or <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49424:15"/> yea or a simple errour, to professe or hold any thing that <hi>Heretiques</hi> or <hi>blasphemers</hi> have professed before? Then certainely it is both <hi>Arch-heresie</hi> and <hi>blasphemy</hi> to hold that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> because the <hi>Arch-blasphemer</hi> the <hi>Divell</hi> once professed it▪ and yet (it is like) beleeveth it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 24. And if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> were but set upon this horse back himselfe, and made to ride as far as he would carry him, he would be the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all <hi>Hereticks</hi> before he return'd back again. He wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld be <hi>Socinian, Arminian, Servetian, Swenkfeldian, Osiandrian, Antitrinitarian, Arrian, Eutychian, Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Valentinian, Novatian, Pelagian, Donatist, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> and what not? Because it is certaine that he holds some opinion in Religion, which all and every one of these held, as the <hi>unity of the Godhead,</hi> and many others. But it may be Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knowes how to distinguish here, as acutely betweene himselfe and his adversary, as some of our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raphicall <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doe, when they tell us that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as they are alledged and cited by them, are the word of <hi>God:</hi> but as they are cited by us, they are the word of the <hi>Divel:</hi> so that the rule or ground of reason, which applyed to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will make him a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick</hi> and <hi>blasphemer,</hi> being applyed to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> upon the same termes, is presently charmed, and looseth all its vertue and operation, and leaves him as <hi>Orthodox,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let me say this likewise, that it is but a knack of <hi>Papish Mountebankerie,</hi> to seeke to oppresse an opinion that any way crosseth them, and to derive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and reproach upon the head of it, by putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evill company, and numbring it amongst the <hi>tenets</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> of such men, as are otherwise obnoxious, and branded with the shame and infamy of some broad errour. Thus <hi>Prateolus</hi> (a <hi>Popish Author</hi>) makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he strikes a great stroke against those, that hold it lawfull to eat any meates upon any day without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a difference, by finding this opinion held by <hi>Jovini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

            <p>I deny not, but <hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe (and some of his followers much more) expresse themselves (sometimes) on the other hand, and doe affirme, the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> for righteousnes, and not the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> (in this uncertainty of expressing themselves,) resembling both Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe, yea and men of farre greater note in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose names for the honour due unto them, upon this occasion I forbeare. But yet Mr. <hi>W.</hi> undertaking the office of an <hi>Interpreter</hi> of their mindes, and meanings this way, (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I easily beleeve, no great friend of theirs) to make his charge against me, and my opinion the more heavy, and sore (as he hopes) hath in many things much eased and lightned their burdens, in the erroneous grossenes of their <hi>opinion,</hi> by his <hi>Interpretation.</hi> Before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate this, I would first know, by what preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Law,</hi> Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> should bee exempted or excused from being an <hi>Arminian,</hi> holding and maintaining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, what <hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe in one place affirmeth: but I at no hand must be excused, holding what the same person affirmeth in another. I know not who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> any power to umpire betweene himselfe and me upon termes of such inequality. And further I desire to be Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> Remembrancer of another thing by the way: That those are called false witnesses by the Holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> that gave Testimony against <hi>Christ,</hi> though they testifie little (in words) against him, but what himselfe indeed spake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 60. 61) Their drawing and wresting his wordes besides his meaning, was enough to brand them, with that black brand. So though Mr. <hi>W.</hi> could (haply) pick out here and there, some <hi>phrases</hi> or <hi>expressions</hi> out of <hi>Arminius</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: that may in the letter and sound of wordes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49424:17"/> come neere some expressions used by mee, in setting downe my opinion: yet if upon this, hee will stand up, and beare <hi>witnesse</hi> against me, or my <hi>opinion,</hi> that we are <hi>Arminian:</hi> this will not save him harmelesse, against the just <hi>imputation</hi> of false <hi>witnesse-bearing.</hi> And as <hi>Anti-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> as himselfe is, or desires to appeare, it were an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter to reconcile him, if <hi>Similitude</hi> or <hi>Sympathie</hi> in speaking, now and then, would doe it. The saying of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this case, is sound and good: <hi>Non in verbis, sed in sensu, fides est, nec idem Symbolum habemus si in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatione dissidemus.</hi> The greatest <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Fathers, in receiving the same <hi>Creed:</hi> yet were they of a farre different <hi>Faith,</hi> and judgement from them, in those Articles of <hi>Religion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Creed.</hi> Now concerning my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> the truth is, that as he hath banished my minde and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of my wordes (in many places) and put his own sowre, and distorted apprehensions in their stead, and would faine make me <hi>father</hi> the bastard-brood of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered imagination: So on the other hand, in laying downe the <hi>Arminian opinion</hi> touching those <hi>Scripture</hi> passages in Question, and the point of <hi>imputation,</hi> though he substitutes also, and rather gives them an opinion, then relates any from them, yet hee playes the part of a good fairy with them, and leaves them a changeling bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour'd then their owne child. But hee had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way or method to bring both ends of his project together, to make the <hi>Arminian tenet</hi> and mine meet, but onely by taking their crooked opinion in his right hand, and my straight opinion in his left; and so bow the one, and unbow the other, till they should run <hi>paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell</hi> together.</p>
            <p>To make good (in few wordes) what I say, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his favourable (but false) <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian notion</hi> (in the things in question,) I desire that these two clauses following, wherein he represents (as he pretends) the opinion of <hi>Arminians,</hi> touching the

               <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> may be diligently compared, with the <hi>interpretations</hi> and explications made of the same opinion, by other <hi>learned, godly, judicious and Orthodox Divines▪</hi> that doubtles have as deepe an insight into those <hi>mysteries,</hi> and know what Spirit of errour it is that ruleth in the Kingdome of <hi>Remonstrancy,</hi> as well as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Wal.</hi> doth: And more particularly, to those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire fully to know, with how little <hi>dexterity</hi> or <hi>integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

Againe (a little after) they are charged to have drawne this their <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>iustification,</hi> out of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Lakes, which yeeld such waters as these: <hi>Meminisse debemus, fidem hanc, Scilicetquà iustificamur, Dei obedientiam esse.</hi> That is, we must remember, that that <hi>Faith</hi> whereby wee are <hi>iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> is the obeying of <hi>God.</hi> And presently after: <hi>In Christum credere nihil aliud est, quàm Deo ad ipsius Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti normam &amp; praescriptum obedientem sepraebere.</hi> That is, To beleeve in <hi>Christ</hi> is nothing else, but for a man to yeild up himselfe in <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>God</hi> according to the rule and prescript of <hi>Christ.</hi> To passe by many other passages in this <hi>chapter,</hi> to the same effect: The <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Doctrine</hi> is further charged, by that <hi>faith,</hi> which it holds to be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> to understand and meane, <hi>fidem ipsam in se, quae apud Deum habeatur pro iustitiâ, quatenus fidei nomine comprehenditur poenitentia, resipiscentia, &amp; in universum obedientia hominis Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani.</hi> So that either M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>VValker,</hi> or these men are fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, in drawing the lineaments of the <hi>Arminian faith</hi> in this point of <hi>imputation.</hi> If M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>W.</hi> will chuse rather to lay the burden upon their shoulder, I suppose it will not much pinch them, because I doe not thinke there is any man else will doe it but himselfe. I acknowledge there are some expressions, used by these great and learned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49424:18"/> men▪ in this tract of their discourse, wherein I desire <hi>Christian</hi> leave to dissent from them: but as well for their ability as integrity, in representing the <hi>true, genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,</hi> and <hi>native</hi> shape both of the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Doctrine</hi> in these points, I thinke their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is unparellable. Consonant unto these things, set downe by them, touching the way of <hi>Remonstrancy</hi> in the point under question, are those briefe passages that are found in <hi>Doctor Prideaux</hi> (a great light of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet living and shining) <hi>Lect. 5. de Iustificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> Having mentioned <hi>Vorstius</hi> opinion, who held <hi>faith</hi> to bee <hi>imputed, immediatè &amp; formaliter; meritum Christi, mediatè &amp; effectivè,</hi> he addes as followeth: <hi>ubi per fidem ulteriùs ostendit, se observationem Christianis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi solummodò intelligere, quia credere idem est, quod obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare Christi praecepta,</hi> that is, by <hi>faith,</hi> he further shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he onely meaneth the observation of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> because to <hi>beleeve,</hi> and to observe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Christ,</hi> are the same. <hi>Nec dispuduit tandem concludere &amp;c.</hi> that is.

I wish that Master <hi>VV.</hi> and his <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> maintaining the <hi>imputation</hi> of the active <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (in the letter and formality of it) for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> did no more endanger or trench upon the merit of <hi>Christs satisfaction,</hi> then either I or mine <hi>opinion</hi> do. I doe not charge any guiltinesse that way upon the man: I verily conceive of him, that it is farre from his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either to deny or to destroy, or in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to wrong or prejudice the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> but for that opinion of his concerning <hi>imputation,</hi> it hath beene arrested and arraigned elsewhere, and was found full, if not of perfect guilt, yet of much jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and suspicion that way. There are severall other things in this tract of his discourse, concerning the corrupt exposition of <hi>Socinus, Arminius &amp;c.</hi> as one or two contradictions, with some such pettie oversights, and diverse things affirmed loosely and at peradventure, without the least proofe or semblance of <hi>truth,</hi> which if matters of exception and advantage, were any thing <hi>rare</hi> and hard to come by, might be improved to good purpose that way. But I rest contented with this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49424:19"/> to make it knowne to the <hi>VVorld,</hi> that Master <hi>Ws. Arminianisme,</hi> and <hi>Arminianisme</hi> indeed, are in many things (and those of mainest importance in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending) as contrary the one to the other, as the <hi>East</hi> is to the <hi>West:</hi> and that the opinion maintained by me, in the notes I left with him, hath as little of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> blood running in the veynes of it, as the <hi>opinion</hi> that himselfe maintaineth, yea and farre lesse too, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were throughly sifted and examined betweene us. The <hi>Arminian Faith,</hi> which they set up for <hi>imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> unto <hi>righteousnes,</hi> includes <hi>obedience</hi> to the Law of <hi>God</hi> Mr. <hi>Walkers Faith,</hi> set up by him for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, includes obedience to the same <hi>Law:</hi> their <hi>faith</hi> an <hi>obedience</hi> performed in their owne person: Mr. <hi>Ws. Faith</hi> or <hi>obedience,</hi> as if it had beene performed in their owne persons. The <hi>Arminian faith</hi> excludes (as we have heard) the merit of <hi>Christs satisfaction</hi> from <hi>iustification:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ws. faith</hi> if it were well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, doth little lesse. For he that hath a perfect legall <hi>righteousnes imputed</hi> unto him upon as good termes, as if he had performed it in his owne person, what need hath he of any <hi>satisfaction,</hi> or attonement by blood, to bee made for him? But I have impleaded this opinion, more at large else where, and have wrung the best weapons out of the hand of the adversary, wherein he most puts his trust. I shall therefore here rest from this labour. And for Mr. <hi>Ws. Arminianisme,</hi> how oft soever he shall afterwards bee troublesome to mee, therewith in his <hi>discourse,</hi> I shall neither be troublesome to my selfe, nor to my <hi>Reader</hi> with it any more; but let it goe for naught, when it comes in my way. Onely this I will say for it, before I here give it over, that so wee may yet have a friendly parting: that if ever I be weary of the <hi>truth</hi> and desire to turne <hi>Arminian,</hi> I will be an <hi>Arminian</hi> of of Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> calculation: his <hi>Arminian,</hi> is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly better, and more harmelesse in his <hi>dogmaticalls,</hi> then any other mans <hi>Arminian</hi> that I can meet with. And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49424:20"/> notwithstanding his <hi>Charity</hi> hath abounded towards the <hi>Arminian</hi> party (as you have heard) yet towards the <hi>Socinian,</hi> it abounds much more. Other <hi>Divines</hi> and Writers generally, represent <hi>Socinianisme</hi> upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> as an accursed <hi>Denier</hi> of <hi>Christs satisfaction. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciniani</hi> (saith Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> in his fifth <hi>Lecture de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatione) impudentius negant, Christum pro peccatis nostris satisfecisse: &amp; ubivis asserunt &amp;c.</hi> that is: The <hi>Socinians</hi> more impudently deny, that <hi>Christ</hi> made any <hi>satisfaction for our sinnes,</hi> and still affirme, that <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father hath received us into grace or favour, by a free condonation or remission of sinnes,</hi> for <hi>Christ.</hi> But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> making them to draw in the same yoke with his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> wipes off this foule aspersion from them, and claps on a <hi>beutie's</hi> spot (in comparison) upon their face, in stead of it: speaking of them both together thus: when they acknowledge that <hi>Christ</hi> his perfect <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is the meritorious cause of our <hi>iustification &amp;c.</hi> So that it seemes Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath wrought a great and miraculous cure upon the <hi>Socinian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> and hath brought it back ten degrees (at least) by which it was gone downe towards <hi>Hell:</hi> It now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <hi>Christs</hi> perfect <hi>satisfaction,</hi> as the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause of our <hi>iustification:</hi> onely it halts upon a lame interpretation, of what it holds consonant to the <hi>truth.</hi> But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (I conceive) was more provident and subtile then angrie men usually are, in displaying the <hi>Socinian heresie</hi> by the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> onely mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a part (and that a very small one too) for the whole: for by this meanes he gaines more liberty▪ and freedome, to draw me and my <hi>opinion</hi> into the reproach, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall thereof.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49424:20"/> Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> having onely a desire and intent to cast dirt in the face of the <hi>truth,</hi> and him that maintaines it, was loath to loose the opportunity of such a kennell.

               </gap>anely of him, that he will cast away his <hi>gold,</hi> to fill his hand with chaff in stead of it.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>truth</hi> is, that in all he hath done (<hi>infolio</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>explication</hi> of this <hi>Scripture,</hi> hee hath onely prospered, in his <hi>interpretation</hi> of the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving:</hi> which prosperity notwithstanding stayeth him, in all (almost) that followeth: and is it not pitty that faire weather should doe harme? In his <hi>exposition</hi> of the two other words, <hi>imputing</hi> and <hi>righteousnesse</hi> he boggles and slunders fouly.</p>
            <p>First, for the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing</hi> a thing to one, hee makes a <hi>supposition,</hi> that to <hi>impute</hi> and <hi>accompt,</hi> or <hi>count,</hi> are universally <hi>termini aequipollentes,</hi> wordes alwayes of one and the same signification. Against which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rision his owne instances from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49424:22"/> have releived him. For 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. Where <hi>Bathshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> saith to <hi>David, I and my Sonne Solomon shall be counted offendors,</hi> it had hardly beene good <hi>English</hi> to have said, <hi>I and my Sonne Solomon shall be imputed offendors.</hi> So <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he.</hi> 13. 13. where it is said of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that they were <hi>counted faithfull,</hi> it would have come off some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rugged, to have said, that they were <hi>imputed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> In some cases, and falls of speech, I confesse they may be of indifferent use, and signification, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in hand: to say that <hi>Abrahams Faith,</hi> either was <hi>counted,</hi> or <hi>imputed</hi> to him for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> are both expressions of good propriety; and not much <hi>difference</hi> betweene them (except a man hath a mind to cavill and wrangle.) And wherein Master <hi>W.</hi> hath strengthned his cause, by making these two terms, <hi>imputing and counting,</hi> to run alwayes hand in hand, I doe not yet apprehend: except it bee by gaining an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of laying on more tongue, and multiplying <hi>discourse:</hi> which how it availeth him in this businesse, hath bin already intimated.</p>
            <p>But the man is no where liker himselfe (as touching the whole cariage of this businesse) then in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he layes downe, of the <hi>sence</hi> or <hi>signification</hi> of the <hi>phrase, imputing</hi> a thing to one, <hi>page</hi> 9. His descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this: <q>the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing</hi> or <hi>counting</hi> a thing to one, signifieth both in the Old and New <hi>Testament,</hi> an act of <hi>judgement</hi> and estimation, by which a thing is judged, esteemed, reckoned, and accounted, to bee as it is indeed.</q>
               <hi>Capiat, qui potis est capere.</hi> Let him understand it, that hath where withall. I confesse Master <hi>Ws. eloquence</hi> passeth my <hi>intelligence.</hi> But</p>
            <p>First, I should have thought (had I not beene here informed otherwise, and may yet for ought I know, strayne curtesie with my information) that <hi>God</hi> his <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> (take <hi>faith</hi> in what <hi>sence</hi> you will) had bin an act of <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and not an act of <hi>judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49424:23"/>
            <p>Secondly, every act of judging or esteeming a thing, to be as indeed it is, is not an <hi>imputing</hi> or <hi>counting</hi> it to another: which yet must bee, if Master <hi>W.</hi> hath rightly defined or described the <hi>signification</hi> and <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing:</hi> because the old stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Law</hi> of a true definition is, that it must be converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that which is <hi>defined.</hi> But that every <hi>iudging</hi> or <hi>esteeming</hi> a thing, to be as indeed it is, is no <hi>imputing</hi> it to another, is evident: because when I judge the Sun to be greater then the Moone, I judge it as indeed it is: yet doe I not <hi>impute</hi> the Sunne to any man. So when I judge and esteeme Master <hi>Ws.</hi> quarrell against mee, to be groundlesse and causelesse, I <hi>iudge</hi> and <hi>esteeme</hi> the thing, as indeed it is: yet doe I not hereby <hi>impute</hi> it to any man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when <hi>God imputes</hi> either my <hi>Faith</hi> unto me, or <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> unto me (the one being the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase,</hi> the other M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>VValkers,</hi>) for my <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> he doth not <hi>iudge,</hi> or <hi>esteeme</hi> any thing to bee as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is: for neither is my <hi>faith,</hi> nor the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> indeed my <hi>righteousnes.</hi> But my <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> is that <hi>Grace</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath consecrated, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring me into <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>fellowship</hi> of that <hi>righteousnes,</hi> that is, of that <hi>iustification</hi> and <hi>redemption</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> by the merit of his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> hath purchased for me, and for all those that <hi>beleeve</hi> in him. Therefore the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing</hi> doth not signifie, an act of <hi>judgement</hi> or estimation, by which a man <hi>iudgeth</hi> or esteemeth a thing to be as indeed it is.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, neither doe any of the instances from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> either of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Testament,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe produceth, any thing willingly, or naturally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this his description, of the signification of the <hi>word, imputing,</hi> as will appeare to any man, that shall but considerately and unpartially umpire betweene them.</p>
            <p>Fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly▪ (and lastly) there are some of these instances,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49424:23"/> that doe manifestly contradict that description of his, and that according to his owne interpretation, of the <hi>phrase imputing,</hi> when he comes to cite them. As that 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19. where <hi>Shimei</hi> saith, <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto mee.</hi> He doth not (saith Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> and that very truely, but contradictingly to himselfe) desire that <hi>David</hi> would not thinke, nor judge, nor <hi>count</hi> his <hi>iniquitie</hi> to be no <hi>iniquitie:</hi> this had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all reason. Therefore (say I) it is against all reason too, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> should say that the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing</hi> both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> still signifies an act of <hi>judgement</hi> and estimation, by which a thing is judged and esteemed, to bee as it is indeed. <hi>Shimei's</hi> act in cursing <hi>David,</hi> was <hi>iniquitie:</hi> and yet <hi>Shimei</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth (neither doth he herein desire any thing sinfull or unlawfull on <hi>Davids</hi> part to grant) that it might not be <hi>imputed,</hi> as, or for <hi>iniquity</hi> unto him. So when <hi>Iob</hi> pleading with <hi>God. Iob</hi> 33. 10. saith that <hi>God counted</hi> him for his enemy: he doth not charge <hi>God</hi> foolishly▪ or affirme any thing unworthy of him: and yet <hi>Iob</hi> was not <hi>Gods</hi> enemy, though it be here said, that <hi>God count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> him so, or, for such. Therefore the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>imputing,</hi> even when it is applyed to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, doth not alwayes signifie such an act of <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>estimation,</hi> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> describeth.</p>
            <p>So in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> where it is said <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. that the <hi>uncircumcision (viz.</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> keeping the <hi>Law</hi>) shall be <hi>counted</hi> for <hi>circumcision,</hi> it is meant of <hi>God</hi> himselfe, that it shall be so <hi>counted</hi> by him. Yet no man I conceive, (except perhaps Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) will say, that <hi>uncircumcision,</hi> is <hi>circumcision</hi> indeed. Where <hi>God</hi> is said; not to <hi>impute sinne (viz▪</hi> to persons <hi>beleeving,</hi> and consequently <hi>justified</hi>) as <hi>Rom. 4. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. the meaning is not, that <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>judge</hi> or <hi>esteeme</hi> a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi> to have <hi>sinne</hi> in him (which were an act of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>estimation,</hi> whereby the thing were <hi>judged</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49424:24"/> that <hi>God</hi> might indeed have dealt in strictnesse of <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with us, and that we are indebted to his free <hi>grace,</hi> that he dealeth not with us as wee have deserved. But concerning the signification or <hi>importance</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>phrase imputing,</hi> (in the busines of <hi>iustification</hi>) more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the meane time let us examine Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, in explaining the third word, <hi>Righteousnes:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall find him no where more left-handed then here. If I knew where his <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick</hi> were, they deserv'd a chiding, to give no better attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Master, where he had such occasion to have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them. But in their absence, this is the best <hi>explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>word, righteousnes,</hi> he can afford us. <q>By <hi>righteousnes</hi> (saith he) is here meant <hi>Euangelicall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> (which is opposed to the legall <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> which is <hi>inherent</hi> in every man, and is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans fulfilling the <hi>Law</hi> in his own person) even the perfect <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> our <hi>Mediatour</hi> and surety, which hee the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> in mans nature performed to the Law, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 11.</q> Riddle mee, riddle me, what's this? For</p>
            <p>First can <hi>Faith</hi> in any <hi>sence,</hi> proper, <hi>tropicall, Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall</hi> (let beggers themselves be chusers here) be said to be <hi>imputed</hi> to us for the <hi>satisfaction,</hi> or <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> I thought Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> opinion had bin, that this <hi>satisfaction</hi> or <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> had beene <hi>imputed</hi> to us for some other thing, but no other thing <hi>imputed</hi> for it. And indeed what (in reason) can bee conceived should be <hi>imputed</hi> unto us, for▪ or instead of the <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> especially according to Mr. <hi>Ws. notion</hi> of <hi>imputation,</hi> wherein it is required, that the thing <hi>imputed,</hi> be truely, really, and indeed the same, with that for <hi>which it is imputed. Surely there is nothing truely really &amp; indeed the same with the satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but this <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> it self. And whether any thing may properly be said, to be truly &amp; indeed the same with it self, I refer to Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> owne determination, when his <hi>Logique</hi> returnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to him. However, if by <hi>righteousnes</hi> (in this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49424:25"/> place) he will needs understand the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> here is a relapse into his former acute interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes the current of the place this: <hi>Faith</hi> that is, the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is <hi>imputed to us for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> that is, for the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Hic furor haud dubius: haec est manifesta phrenesis.</q>
            <p>Secondly why he should call the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> an <hi>Euangelicall righteousnes,</hi> and that with such <hi>emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call opposition</hi> to the <hi>legall,</hi> and yet define a <hi>legall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> to be, <hi>every mans fulfilling of the Law</hi> in his owne person, I want Mr. <hi>Ws. intellect</hi> to comprehend. Surely <hi>Christs righteousnes was a fulfilling of the Law in his owne person:</hi> I doe not know (nor I thinke Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> himselfe, though he knowes so much more then I doe) any other man that perform'd it for him, yea himselfe (in the close of this period) acknowledgeth it to have beene performed by himselfe unto the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas he affirmes a <hi>legall righteousnes</hi> of <hi>workes</hi> to be inherent in every mans person, it may bee he consulted with his own <hi>Logick</hi> about his expression: but surely other mens never advised him so to speake. <hi>Workes</hi> or <hi>actions</hi> are matters <hi>transient,</hi> not <hi>inherent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, why he should say that to be <hi>inherent</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, which was never <hi>inherent</hi> in any man, (no not in his owne <hi>sence</hi> of <hi>inherency) Christ</hi> onely excepted, I beleeve it would a little trouble him, to give a faire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, why he should affirme the <hi>Euangelicall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to be a <hi>satisfaction</hi> performed to the <hi>Law,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> himselfe can give no better reason then I can, it must either passe by <hi>authority,</hi> and by <hi>vertue</hi> of the <hi>writ, Ipse dixit,</hi> or else be arrested and staied. For though the <hi>active obedience</hi> or <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> may be called a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> in as much as the <hi>Law</hi> requires such <hi>obedience</hi> from all men: and that properly is a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49424:25"/> either to a person or thing, when the whole is given, that is required or demanded. But how the <hi>death</hi> or <hi>passive obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (which I conceive Mr. <hi>W.</hi> chiefly intendeth, in the <hi>word satisfaction</hi>) should bee a <hi>satisfaction</hi> performed to the <hi>Law,</hi> it will take more of my thoughts to apprehend, then yet I have leysure to bestow upon it. The <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>satisfied</hi> in that perfect and intire <hi>obedience,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> exhibited to it, from the beginning of his life to the end: and did not require of him (no more then it doth of any other man that shall fulfill it, as hee did) that he should be made a <hi>curse,</hi> or dye the death. If Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> meaning bee, that the death of <hi>Christ</hi> was a <hi>satisfaction</hi> performed to the <hi>Law</hi> for us, or on our behalfe, in respect of our <hi>sinnes:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that he doth not yet hit the joint: for this is no part of the demands of the Law, that an <hi>innocent</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi> person should dye, but onely the <hi>transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> and <hi>disobedient.</hi> Therefore when a <hi>righteous</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dieth, it is rather a crossing, then a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Law:</hi> because the <hi>Law</hi> promiseth life, to those that keep and fulfill it, &amp; do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h no wayes threaten or impose death upon them. It is true, the death of <hi>Christ</hi> was satisfactory for the sinnes of the world; but to whom was it a <hi>satisfaction?</hi> not to the <hi>Law,</hi> which neither required, nor demanded it, nor yet had any power to release, or discharge her <hi>Prisoners,</hi> and condemned ones, upon the tender and payment of it: the <hi>Law</hi> knowes no <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on▪</hi> But to <hi>God</hi> (the <hi>Law giver</hi>) who had a power over and beyond his <hi>Law,</hi> it was a <hi>satisfaction,</hi> because hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed required it, and to him it was tendred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Sixtly (and lastly) this Dedalian Divine, makes no clever worke, when he jumbles together the <hi>active,</hi> and <hi>passive, obedience of Christ,</hi> and sets the <hi>passive</hi> before the <hi>active,</hi> and subjecteth them to the same consideration, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their performance to the <hi>Law.</hi> But his greater oversights are good for nothing, except it be to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadow
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49424:26"/> his lesser, therefore it is pitty this priviledge should be denyed unto them.</p>
            <p>I conceive by this time M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Ws.</hi> owne heart smites him, and tel's him, that he hath not quitted himselfe in the opening of his <hi>Scriptures,</hi> answerably to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reposed in him, by those that chose him for their Champion. <hi>Pauls imputation</hi> is yet a secret; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Ws.</hi> interpretation hath passed upon it, yea, by tampering with a false key, he hath made the Lock harder to open then it was before. If any man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, long's for contradictions, or other absurdities of the blood, I can yet relieve them out of this tract of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

               <hi>Ws.

If <hi>God</hi> puts the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> it selfe, of <hi>Christ,</hi> upon a <hi>beleevers skore,</hi> he must put the merit of it also upon the same <hi>skore,</hi> for these are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable.

            <p>Here the Answerer buckles on his <hi>harnesse,</hi> and meanes to fight stoutly for his beloved <hi>Dalila,</hi> the beautifull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation hitherto given by him, of the words in question: onely I desire you to remember, and to carry steadily, and distinctly in minde with you, what this <hi>interpretation</hi> was, that so you may the better discern and judg, how close the sute of his Arguments and proofes, sits upon the back of his <hi>interpretation</hi> to be proved. The Summe and effect of his <hi>interpretation</hi> (as you have heard) and if any thing can be made of it, this is) <hi>Faith aprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ or the righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ, is imputed to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, for the Evangelicall righteousnesse of Christ.</hi> Now let us see how he laye's about him, and with what sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Dexterity,</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi> he proves twise fifteene, to make just three and twenty.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Argument</hi> (saith he) is drawne from the wordes of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. &amp;c. He may well say, his <hi>Argument</hi> is <hi>drawne,</hi> and might have added, <hi>Obtorto collo,</hi> by head and shoulders: the man in forging this <hi>argument,</hi> labours (as it were) in the very fire, and though he gives it heat upon heat, yet he brings it to no shape or perfection at all, at the last, but is in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging of it, as a wild Bull in a Net (which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay's</hi> comparison in another case) who beates and teares himselfe with strugling, but knowes not how to expedite or deliver himselfe ever the more. If a mans reason, wits, or understanding, had offended him, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath provided rods of Scorpions in the carriage of this <hi>Argument,</hi> to scourge them with. I might very lawfully excuse my selfe from saying any thing by way
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49424:27"/> of Answere to this <hi>Argument,</hi> by authority of that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               </q> that is,
<q>
                  <l>Vnderstood what will not be,</l>
                  <l>To neglect you may be free.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe I hope will (in part) excuse me, if I cannot find out the quadrature of his circle: I confesse I was never made for that speculation, neither take I any contentment to fish in such troubled waters? Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, something must be done, Gamesters must play bad games and hard casts, as well as good.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> so largely insist's upon, to prove his <hi>interpretation</hi> of the former, <hi>viz</hi> that <hi>faith</hi> (in a <hi>tropicall sense,</hi> that is, as it signifieth the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>) is <hi>imputed</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> for the <hi>Evangelicall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is this: <hi>Rom. 2. 26. If the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision keepe the righteousnesse of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</hi> Surely this <hi>Scripture,</hi> if it were well managed, would do good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice towards the pulling downe of the said <hi>Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but for the building of it up, it can do none at all, till it selfe be pulled downe; I meane the <hi>true sense</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of it destroyed, which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>W.</hi> labours hard, and with both his hands to doe in this place; and yet when he hath done all, he hath (upon the matter) done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing. For if all the particulars were granted in the first and most liberall manner, for which he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth about the meaning of this <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet would they operate no more, then what might be summ'd up in a Cypher, towards the establishing of the other <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> (which is the thing intended by him) as will evidently appeare to a considering <hi>Reader.</hi> What if he could prove that here were <hi>trope,</hi> upon <hi>trope,</hi> and mountaines of <hi>metonymies;</hi> doth this prove a necessity of finding either the same <hi>number,</hi> or the same kind of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49424:28"/>
               <hi>tropes</hi> or <hi>figures,</hi> in an other <hi>Scripture?</hi> And yet in this consequence, lieth the best part of the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>sinewes</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> Argument from this place.</p>
            <p>But let us make something of nothing, as well as we can, and give you a tast of his profound <hi>interpretation</hi> of this <hi>Scripture.</hi> By <hi>uncircumcision</hi> (saith he) in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer clause, we cannot understand the <hi>foreskin</hi> of the <hi>flesh</hi> &amp;c. (but a <hi>Gentile</hi> not <hi>circumcised,</hi> &amp;c.) By the same word in the latter clause, not the <hi>foreskin,</hi> or <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> in a <hi>proper sense</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of him that is <hi>uncircumcised,</hi> and yet not this neither barely considered in it <hi>selfe,</hi> but as <hi>comprehending</hi> in it the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> &amp;c. And yet immediately he adds, that this word further in this very place, signifieth the man in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>uncircumcision,</hi> keeping the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and yet this <hi>figuratively</hi> too, for the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> by him performed. I thinke we are in the Quagmires or quick-sands already, but let us goe forward, and we shall be sure to be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have done.

Thus we have (with much adoe) spelled Mr. <hi>Ws. interpretation</hi> of this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Now let us put together, and see what we have gotten. <hi>If a Gentile not circumcised, keepe the Law, shall not his state and condition, not barely considered in it selfe, but as comprehending in it, the righteousnesse of the Law,</hi> that is, The man in the state of <hi>uncircumcision,</hi> keeping the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> by him performed, be <hi>judged▪ accepted,</hi> and used accordingly, as the <hi>circumcision</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> in the <hi>Spirit?</hi> This is the expresse <hi>tenor,</hi> and <hi>carriage</hi> of his <hi>exposition</hi> of this <hi>Scripture,</hi> conceived in his owne words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Something I have left out, which would be as Oyle to encrease the fire, and would burden the <hi>interpretation</hi> further, as <hi>viz.</hi> where he brings up a false report upon <hi>Gods gracious intent,</hi> in giving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or <hi>Seale</hi> of <hi>circumcision,</hi> to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> It was (saith he) an obligation, by which the <q>
                  <hi>circumcised</hi> was bound under paine of cutting off fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to performe the whole <hi>Law,</hi> and to prove this so irrationall, and extravagant a supposition, hee misuseth that <hi>Scripture, Gal.</hi> 5. 3. I testify to every man that is <hi>circumcised,</hi> that he is a debtor to doe the whole <hi>Law,</hi>
               </q> which place doth not speake of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon men from <hi>God,</hi> to doe the whole <hi>Law,</hi> under paine of damnation, or cutting off for ever, for then miserable had the case and condition bin of the whole <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who generally, from the time when <hi>circumcision</hi> was first given by <hi>God,</hi> to their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> were <hi>circumcised</hi> till now, and yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely none of them performed the whole <hi>Law,</hi> but failed or offended more or lesse, in many things (as <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh) and so by the cruel Sword of Mr. <hi>VVs. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> must be all cut off from <hi>God</hi> for ever. But the Apostles meaning clearely in this <hi>Scripture</hi> is to shew, that if any man were <hi>circumcised</hi> in such a way, or with any such purpose or intent, as the <hi>Iewish teachers</hi> of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> amongst them urged, and pressed them unto: that is, with a conceipt of the necessitie thereof to <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> then were they in <hi>reason</hi> bound, as wel to observe all other points of the <hi>Law,</hi> as that of <hi>circumcision,</hi> there being no ground to hope they should be <hi>iustified,</hi> by the observation of one thing in the <hi>Law,</hi> if any other were neglected. For the rule of <hi>God</hi> in this case is, <hi>Cursed be he that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law, to doe them.</hi> This is <hi>Calvins exposition</hi> of this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49424:29"/> place, or very little differing from it. But when men crie out against <hi>reason,</hi> as the Answerer in great passion doth, in the sequel of his discourse, they receive but a just <hi>recompence,</hi> of reward, to be delivered up into the hand of <hi>Non-sense.</hi> But let <hi>Non-sense</hi> say what it will, the man will not be dash'd out of countenance, by it, but wil need's set this Crown of fine <hi>Gold,</hi> upon the head of his Leaden <hi>interpretation,</hi> strike it off who dares, and makes him a Rebel, or Traytor, that shall rise up against it. This <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>meaning,</hi> of the wordes and of this <hi>phrase,</hi> is <q>so cleare, and manifest, and so perfectly agreeable to all true <hi>reason,</hi> that none can deny it, unlesse he will set himselfe to rebell against the <hi>light.</hi> I thought he would have lik'd his <hi>interpretation</hi> the worse,</q> for being agreeable to any <hi>reason,</hi> and so would any other man thinke, that shall but read his invective. <hi>Pag</hi> 27. against that great enemie of his, which still thwarteth, and contradicteth him, in most of his <hi>undertakings▪ Right Reason.</hi> And it doth no lesse in this place, though here he would faine be friends, and scrape acquaintance with it.</p>
            <p>But when he comes to <hi>parallell</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> last <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted</hi> by him (as you have heard) and his <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> thereof, with the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in question, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts a conformity betweene them in their <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> he falls into such a <hi>Rhetoricall</hi> rage and fury, and buffets his reader, so thick and so fast, with <hi>tropes,</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> that it is not for a meane man to come neare his meaning (at least if his meaning be mans meat, any thing prepared for the <hi>understanding</hi>) by 40 foot. He had need have <hi>Angels</hi> for his readers, or men of <hi>Angelicall comprehensions,</hi> otherwise his tyrannicall and sterne <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> will be ready to laugh them in the face to scorne: Onely thus much, a man of low <hi>apprehensions,</hi> and that wants both <hi>Logique,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorique,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably complaines, <hi>pag</hi> 28. 29. that his adversary doth) may evidently perceive; that here with his left handed

               <hi>Retorique,</hi> he quite pulls downe the good <hi>interpretation</hi> of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving</hi> (in his <hi>Scripture</hi>) which he had formerly built up with his right-handed <hi>reason.</hi> For if you looke back to <hi>pag</hi> 6. there you shall find him with this description of that <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving,</hi> which is here sayd to be <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> Here by <hi>Faith</hi> we are to understand, that <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall guift,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>beleeving,</hi> wrought in the <hi>Elect</hi> by the <hi>Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Which whether it be a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> or <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>faith properly</hi> (yea, most <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) taken, I am not much afrayd to make the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Judge.

            <p>I <hi>answere,</hi> first to the <hi>Proposition,</hi> by distinguishing that <hi>expression,</hi> bringeth with it a reward, out of it's ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, whereof the <hi>Disputer</hi> makes his whole advantage in this <hi>Argument</hi> (being indeed his owne <hi>Language,</hi> and not the <hi>Language</hi> of that <hi>Scripture,</hi> upon which he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49424:30"/> pretends to build his <hi>Argument</hi>) A thing may be sayd to bring with it a reward, two severall waies at least (besides many others,) either first by way of <hi>voluntary</hi> and free <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>compact;</hi> or secondly, by way of <hi>merit,</hi> or just <hi>retribution,</hi> and <hi>compensation.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a man may promise to as many as he pleaseth, that if they will but come over the way to him, he will give them the same money or reward, upon their coming, which the <hi>Law</hi> appointeth (or which <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> would allow) to a Labourer for 7 dayes worke or Labour. In this case, the crossing the way onely, by vertue of the promise made upon such termes, brings the same reward with it, which the labour, and travaile of 7 dayes doth. If Mr <hi>W.</hi> takes the phrase of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it a reward in the former <hi>sense, viz.</hi> by way of <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>proposition</hi> is granted for truth: but then his <hi>assumption</hi> will halt right downe; Because <hi>Faith</hi> brings with it a reward in this <hi>sense,</hi> as well as the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> doth in the other. If he meanes the clause in the other <hi>sense, viz.</hi> by way of <hi>merit:</hi> so the <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>position</hi> is to be arrested for <hi>falshood;</hi> for that which is accounted for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> doth not necessarily bring with it a reward, upon such termes, or in such a way. <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>gracious,</hi> and free <hi>Covenant,</hi> hath promised the same (if not greater) reward, to those that shall beleeve in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which he hath promised to those that shall keepe the whole <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Assumption</hi> I likewise answere, that it is sick of that common disease in argumentation, which they call, <hi>fallacia divisionis.</hi> Those things are divided and put asunder, which <hi>God</hi> hath joyned together, <hi>viz. Christ</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> in bringing the great reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life unto the creature. See <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. Ioh. 6. 40. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 2. besides other places (without number) of like importance: in all which, <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>beleeving</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> is found in perfect conjunction with <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, (not in <hi>opposition</hi> to him, as here it is) about the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49424:31"/> matter of <hi>iustification</hi> and <hi>salvation.</hi> It's true, there is an <hi>opposition</hi> betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> even in the businesse of <hi>iustification;</hi> but this is in the manner, not in the matter it selfe of <hi>iustification:</hi> for both <hi>iustifie Christ</hi> and <hi>faith (Rom</hi> 5. 1, 2.) and consequently, both bring eternall life: but <hi>Christ</hi> doth it in that way which is meet for him and proper to him, and <hi>Faith</hi> doth it in another way proper to it. <hi>Christ iustifieth,</hi> by way of merit, <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>attonement</hi>-making with <hi>God</hi> for <hi>sinne: Faith iustifieth,</hi> as ordained by <hi>God</hi> to bring men into <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>fellowship</hi> of that <hi>ransome, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,</hi> or <hi>satisfaction</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath made. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>minor proposition</hi> also is manifestly false, which makes an <hi>opposition</hi> betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> it selfe (wherein the <hi>Scriptures</hi> still make them to accord) whereas the <hi>opposition</hi> that is betweene them, stands in the severall manner, or diversity of <hi>influence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same <hi>iustification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His third <hi>argument</hi> followeth, which is built cleane besides the <hi>foundation</hi> it claimeth, which is the sixt and seventh <hi>verses</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute righteousnes</hi> without <hi>workes</hi> to him that <hi>beleeveth.</hi> This <hi>Argument,</hi> if any thing at all can bee made of it, (which indeed is very little) must rise up in this forme of reason.</p>
            <p>If the thing <hi>imputed</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> be <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and no <hi>righteousnes</hi> else is to bee found amongst mankind, but <hi>Christs</hi> perfect <hi>righteousnes</hi> onely, then must the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> needs be that which is <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Sed verum prius: ergo &amp; posterius.</q>
            <p>To this <hi>argument</hi> I answere. First that the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he here raiseth from the <hi>promises, viz</hi> that <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> must needs be that which is <hi>imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> is <hi>diametrally</hi> opposite to himselfe, in severall passages of this discourse alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49424:31"/> examined, and particularly to what hee affirmed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the close of his first <hi>argument, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Faith</hi> of a man, which doth not rest on his owne <hi>workes</hi> for <hi>iustification,</hi> comprehending in it <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>righter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> unto him. Surely <hi>faith</hi> comprehending the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> comprehended by <hi>Faith,</hi> are as farre differing one from the other, as Mr. <hi>Ws. opinion</hi> and mine are in this controversie, take them at their greatest <hi>elongation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I answere more particularly and fully, that had Mr. <hi>W.</hi> understood the <hi>Apostles phrase,</hi> of <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting righteousnes (verse</hi> 6.) he would never have sought footing for any such <hi>argument</hi> here. He supposeth, that when <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>impute righteousnes</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> he must needs have a proper, literall and <hi>preexistent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> for the matter of such his <hi>imputation,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he conceiveth the <hi>Apostles</hi> expression cannot stand, which <hi>supposition</hi> we may number amongst many other Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> mistakes in this his answere, and yet not doe it the least wrong: For</p>
            <p>First it is not here said, that <hi>God imputeth</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (with an article) a <hi>righteousnes;</hi> but indefinitely, and without an article, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which is a faire intimation (at least) that he doth not here speake of any particular or speciall <hi>righteousnes</hi> fixed in any subject, as the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Secondly if by <hi>righteousnes</hi> here said to bee <hi>imputed</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> be meant the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>tenor</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> owne <hi>exposition,</hi> formerly mentioned, the strayne of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this passage must be this, that <hi>God imputeth the righteousnes of Christ,</hi> for the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to him that <hi>beleeveth see page</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that <hi>imputing righteousnes</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> which is here ascribed to <hi>God</hi> is said to be an <hi>imputing righteousnes,</hi> without <hi>workes.</hi> Now the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49424:32"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> is so far from being a <hi>righteousnes</hi> without <hi>works,</hi> that <hi>workes</hi> are the very <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>essence</hi> of it. If it be objected and said, that this is meant concerning a mans owne <hi>works,</hi> that <hi>God imputes</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> unto him, without th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se, not otherwise; To this I answere, First that such a distinction or limitation as this is, hath no <hi>foundation,</hi> at al either in this or any other <hi>Scripture.</hi> Secondly, here is not the least necessity, or occasion to <hi>invocate</hi> the aid or assistance of any such distinction. Here is no streight or difficultie against which we should be relieved by it. Now to coyne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, where there is neither ground in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor necessity in reason for it, is no les then (being interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted) to coyne new <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Thirdly (and lastly) it is but vaine and frivolous, (especially <hi>quoad homines,</hi> in respect of those that maintaine Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> way of <hi>imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because they hold, that this <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ imputed;</hi> by <hi>vertue</hi> of this <hi>imputation</hi> becomes or is made ours, so, or upon such termes, as if it were in deed, and in truth, properly and personally ours, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our selves.

            <p>Fourthly, if by <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> is here said to <hi>impute,</hi> be meant the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> then is the description or explication of this <hi>imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> which immediately followeth, (<hi>verse</hi> 7. and 8.) very impertinent and unproper, being conceived and layd downe in these three expressions, the <hi>forgivenesse of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, the covering of sinnes,</hi> the <hi>not imputing sinne.</hi> The <hi>imputing</hi> of <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> (in the sence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) is much more then the <hi>forgivenesse</hi> of <hi>iniquities;</hi> or the not <hi>imputing sinne.</hi> As the putting on of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>apparell</hi> upon a man, is much more, then not to cloath him with <hi>ragges.</hi> Therefore</p>
            <p>Fifthly, (and lastly) by <hi>Gods imputing righteousnes</hi> in this place, is meant, onely his <hi>justifying men,</hi> or (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> owne <hi>Interpretation</hi> of this <hi>Scripture phrase, pag.</hi> 10. of this his discourse) a dealing with men, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them accordingly, as if they were <hi>righteous.</hi> To

               <p>If that which is here sayd to be <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to <hi>justification,</hi> and there be nothing that will serve for such <hi>righteousnes,</hi> but that which is found in <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>mediator,</hi> then must somewhat in <hi>Christ,</hi> here be sayd to be <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not his <hi>faith.</hi> But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> in this <hi>proposition,</hi> is true.

               <p>There is nothing in this <hi>Argument,</hi> but what (for the substance of it) was contained in the two former, and hath bin already sufficiently answer'd.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> Fift, and last <hi>argument,</hi> comes now upon the Stage, but hath such a viz or upon the face of it, that a man cannot tell of what Shape or complexion it is, only thus far the thing is evident, from his owne wordes, that here he <hi>Starts,</hi> or rather <hi>Coniures</hi> up a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, as far differing from what he laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in his 4 former <hi>arguments,</hi> as the <hi>East</hi> is from the <hi>West.</hi> For thus he writes here (<hi>stylo novo</hi>) that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,</hi>
                  <q>or <hi>counting</hi> a thing for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is no more but DECLARING a man thereby to be <hi>righteous,</hi>

               <p>How he meanes to proceed, he sufficiently declares in his beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> by the rule and method of <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>frowardnesse.</hi> If the first fruites bee sowre and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, so is the whole lump like to bee also.

               <p>But the rude multitude of my <hi>Disciples</hi> are a great offence unto him, by proclaiming mee to bee the great light of the <hi>Church &amp;c.</hi> (Who Mr. <hi>W.</hi> meanes by my rude <hi>disciples,</hi> I know not: neither (I beleeve) doth he know himselfe. If I knew them, I would send them to him to learne better manners, and to be taught more <hi>elegant</hi> behaviour. But they proclaime mee the great light of <hi>Gods Church.</hi> Surely this was whil'st Mr. <hi>W.</hi> slept: these rude fellowes got in by the dore of his nostrills, and so clamber'd up into his <hi>Crowne,</hi> and there playd their prankes, and made that <hi>sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49424:40"/> proclamation. But more soberly: suppose these fellowes indeed spake such wordes of me, what will Mr. <hi>W.</hi> give me, and I will pull off the fooles bable from my head, and he shall have it to set on his: if he longs, his longing shall not cost him much: he shall have it at a very low rate. I will entreat my <hi>disciples</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him, this great light <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the multitude of my <hi>disciples</hi> stick in his stomack too.

And yet I conceive the number of the men hee meanes, may be somewhat encreased, by his owne <hi>unreasonable, un-Christian, and furious proceedings</hi> against me. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull enemy many times begets friends.</p>
               <p>But how shall I doe? he wounds mee on the heele, and takes me tardy with a contradiction. Well: I see it is no halting before a cripple. A man cannot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit a contradiction, but Mr. <hi>W.</hi> a man so much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseene in contradictions, will find it out.

                  </q> I confesse I do not remember, that ever I met with this golden rule to measure a <hi>bold lying Sophister</hi> by, so punctually in any <hi>Logique,</hi> or <hi>Logician</hi> I have read: and though I easily grant Mr. <hi>VVs.</hi> reading to have out-compassed mine, yet I beleeve, that neither hath he met with this rule in all his sphere of reading; but we have it here new out of the mint of his owne braine, the fire is not yet out of it, <hi>Logicians</hi> are wont to speake with reason, and sobriety, and not to cal their <hi>Brethren, bold lying Sophisters:</hi> the thrid is too course ever to have bin spun unpon their Wheele; well, but let us grant this profound <hi>axiome</hi> to be true: What is the truth thereof to evince my ignorance in <hi>Logique</hi> more then my knowledge that twise two make foure, is to prove Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ignorant in <hi>Arithmetique?</hi>

I argue the <hi>imputing</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>righteousnesse</hi> in a <hi>proper sense</hi> (that is, in the very same <hi>sense,</hi> that himselfe hath formerly given, and approved againe, and againe, in this his discourse, as hath bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy observed from hence, because the <hi>phrase</hi> is so often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this <hi>Chap.</hi> without any alteration or exchange; and affirme withall, that the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> for our <hi>righteousnes</hi> (in the <hi>sense</hi> rejected in my former <hi>Chapter,</hi> and which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> must maintaine, or else I cannot count him an adversarie in the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) hath not the least reliefe, either from found of wordes, or sight of <hi>Letter</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> answers, that <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. the <hi>Lord</hi> is sayd to repent 3 sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49424:42"/> times in an unproper <hi>sense,</hi> &amp;c. and hence inferres, that the frequent, and constant use of a <hi>phrase,</hi> doth not prove a proper acception of it &amp;c. Which conclusion indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly taken, and in the generall, is unquestionably true: and his instances, are currant proofs hereof. I will deny nothing that he speakes with <hi>reason,</hi> but freely assent to him, and commend him; because I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to speake more upon such terms.</p>
               <p>But yet he might have pleased here to have conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that rule which <hi>Austine</hi> long since gave, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> generally have approved from him; that a <hi>literall,</hi> and <hi>proper sense</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is still to be preferr'd, where there is no necessity of rejecting it, or <hi>substituting</hi> a <hi>tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or <hi>improper</hi> in the stead. And except this rule be admitted as unquestionable, the cleerest, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse truths in <hi>Scripture,</hi> will still be <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>dispute,</hi> and <hi>controversie,</hi> and may be tossed up and downe, by the wills, and wits of men. Now this rule wholly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuates the strength of his answere: because in those <hi>Scriptures</hi> produced by him, there is an apparent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of having recourse to an <hi>improper signification</hi> of the words, because the <hi>litterall,</hi> and <hi>proper,</hi> imports a manifest contradiction, to common <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason;</hi> as is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident to him that shal but a little consider those and the like <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And in such a case as this, where there is no danger or feare, that the <hi>literall sense</hi> should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, because the very principles of <hi>reason,</hi> are ready to cry out against it: the holy <hi>Pen-men</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> may use a <hi>metaphoricall expression,</hi> 10 times together, and twenty times after that; the frequency of the <hi>repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> will never be any <hi>proofe,</hi> or <hi>argument,</hi> of a <hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>literall signification.</hi> But in the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>phrase contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> betweene Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> and me, the case is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: the <hi>literall,</hi> and <hi>proper sense,</hi> may here be taken, no rule of <hi>reason,</hi> (no nor of <hi>Religion</hi> neither, as hath bin proved both here, and elsewhere) gainsaying it, (at least not manifestly, nor notoriously contradicting i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49424:43"/> and therefore the frequent, and constant use of such a <hi>phrase,</hi> is a strong inducement (at least) that the <hi>literall</hi> and <hi>proper sense</hi> is here to be imbraced.</p>
               <p>Whereas (towards the close of this answere) he breakes out againe, and gives me a new Livery of the <q>same Cloath, with the former, calling me <hi>bold lying Sophister,</hi> for affirming most <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>impudently,</hi>

                  </q> Wee are come now towards the bottome of the heap, where (it seemes) the grossest and thickest of the <hi>lies</hi> are setled.

                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </q> that is, <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>qualification</hi> to us for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving:</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49424:46"/> for what is the <hi>receiving, applying,</hi> and <hi>enioying</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>beleeved</hi> (as was before observed.)</p>
               <p>But with these two <hi>errors</hi> dropping from him, it seemes his memory dropped also, for by this time he hath forgot his <hi>enterprize,</hi> and instead of proving what I had said, a grosse <hi>errour,</hi> he onely complaines of it, <q>as a <hi>harsh unsavoury</hi> and <hi>absurd phrase.</hi> And to <hi>justifie</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, he tell us, that to say <hi>God</hi> requires the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not for our <hi>iustification,</hi> but of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, implies, that <hi>Christ</hi> had need of <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> and was bound to fulfill the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe: which savours of the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Samosatenian heresie,</hi> and denyes <hi>Christs God-head,</hi> with much more (as the manner of the man is)</q>
               </p>
               <q>Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?</q>
               <p>Is not this a solid and demonstrative proofe, of the <hi>harshnesse</hi> and <hi>unsavourinesse</hi> of this saying, <hi>God</hi> requires not of us the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Hee that can make these <hi>premisses</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi> hang, may well set up the trade of <hi>gluing Oyster-shells,</hi> and undertake to make the yron and the clay in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, mix and worke together. He that saith, that <hi>God</hi> doth not require of us the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for our <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> doth not so much as in colour or shew, affirme, that he therefore requires it of him, for his owne <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> onely it seemes to imply, that hee required it of him for our <hi>justification:</hi> which (I conceive) is no <hi>harsh</hi> or <hi>unsavoury,</hi> but a <hi>proposition</hi> well pleasing to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p>But setting aside the irrelativenesse and impertinency of what he affirmeth here, to what hee had in hand to proove, I could (I conceive) put some <hi>queries</hi> to him, that would a little trouble him, to make good the <hi>truth</hi> thereof in a <hi>positive</hi> way. As</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49424:46"/>
               <p>First, how he can prove, that <hi>Christ</hi> had no need of <hi>iustification?</hi> Surely <hi>Christ</hi> was a <hi>iustified,</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi> person, in the sight of <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>iustification</hi> was not <hi>superfluous,</hi> or no wayes usefull to him. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not <hi>superfluous,</hi> we men of the lower forme of <hi>learning</hi> and understanding, <hi>judge</hi> to bee some wayes needfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly how he would prove, that <hi>Christ</hi> was not bound to fulfill the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for himself? Certaine I am, that some <hi>Divines</hi> of our owne Church, and <hi>Nation,</hi> no whit inferiour to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>choycenesse</hi> of <hi>learning</hi> or soundnesse of <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (and yet neither <hi>Wotton,</hi> nor <hi>Goodwin,</hi> nor any of their <hi>Disciples</hi>) have written otherwise: <hi>Christ</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> in his second <hi>Lect</hi> on the <hi>Heb.</hi>) by the spirit, still fill'd his <hi>manhood</hi> more and more with <hi>grace,</hi> till the fulnesse of all <hi>righteousnes</hi> was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, that so his manhood might inherit <hi>salvation,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>promise, doe this and live.</hi> But hitherto as he is <hi>righteous,</hi> so hee is <hi>righteous</hi> for <hi>himselfe,</hi> and onely that man is yet blessed which was <hi>conceived</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he that holds, that <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>man,</hi> was not bound to fulfill the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his continuance on Earth in the <hi>flesh,</hi> must (if hee will be true to his <hi>principles</hi>) hold with all, that <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>man</hi> had a liberty, or <hi>dispensation</hi> from his <hi>God-head,</hi> to transgresse in respect of himselfe: and that this <hi>dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> could not take place, or bee put in <hi>execution,</hi> onely because of that <hi>worke</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. It may be this is no such <hi>Camell,</hi> but Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> can swallow, without strayning. But I hope he will not be offended, if they that stand charged with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>blasphemies</hi> already, bee unwilling to charge themselves yet further with this also.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I would put him upon this, to prove such an absolute <hi>inconsistency,</hi> or <hi>diametrall opposition,</hi> as he seemes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49424:47"/> to imagine, betweene <hi>Christs</hi> fulfilling the <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe, and for us, as if at no hand they could stand together. Surely Mr. <hi>W.</hi> when he compil'd and wrote this answere, he wrote it both for himselfe, that is: for the discharge of such a <hi>conscience</hi> as he hath; and for others also, that is, for the good, benefit and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of mee, and many others. And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in that 190. <hi>Epistle,</hi> (cited by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) speaking of the work of <hi>Redemption</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ,</hi> affirmeth it to have beene, <hi>Opus aequè nostrum, &amp; suum, &amp; Angelorum,</hi> that is, a <hi>worke</hi> indifferently ours, and his owne, and the <hi>Angels:</hi> and then goeth on, shewing how respectively.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (and lastly) it would cost him many of his thoughts, and much of his Learning, to give a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and cleare accompt, how it should any way intrench, or so much as looke towards the deniall of <hi>Christs God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> to conceive that <hi>Christ</hi> might be bound to fulfill the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> for himselfe. I conceive it tends farre more dangerously to shake the truth of his <hi>humanity,</hi> to deny that he was any waies bound to keepe the <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe. And as the error of the <hi>vbiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</hi> tends to dissolve the truth of his <hi>manhood, viâ natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,</hi> so doth this opinion of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (which yet he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with that fearelesse confidence) as farre as yet I am able to see into it, tend to the same end, <hi>via mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is marvailous improbable unto me, that hee should be the Seed of the Woman, who by the Law of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should not be bound, to keepe that <hi>Law,</hi> which both the man and the Woman stood bound to keepe in their innocencie. And as the personall <hi>union</hi> with the <hi>God-head,</hi> could not privilege his <hi>humane nature,</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> against those properties which are <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>essentiall</hi> to it, as <hi>locality, quantity, finitenesse, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surablenes</hi> to its place, nor <hi>communicate</hi> or convey over to it, those properties of <hi>immensitie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49424:47"/> &amp;c. which are <hi>essentiall</hi> to the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> So neither could it priviledge his <hi>manhood,</hi> against those <hi>morall habitudes, relations,</hi> or <hi>conditions,</hi> which are as <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall</hi> to such a creature in another way, as <hi>viz.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto <hi>God,</hi> obligation of serving him, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his will, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Christ's</hi> meriting his exaltation, I shall not strive with him for the present. Onely (I beleeve) wee have neither of us waded so farre (in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations) into those <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which speak to this point, but that we may wade yet deeper, and know more concerning it, then we do. As <hi>viz. Rev. 5. 12. Heb. 12 2. Phil. 2. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Luk</hi> 24. 26. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There remaine now but two little shovel-fulls more of the <hi>dunghill</hi> or heap of <hi>lies</hi> that troubled Mr. <hi>W.</hi> so excessively, to be removed, and then the street (in this place) will be cleane.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Another grosse errour</hi> (he saith) is, that I call <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleeving,</hi> a thing done and performed by us, when as the <hi>Apostle</hi> affirmes, and all <hi>Christians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that our <hi>beleeving</hi> is not of our selves, but the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>God &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q> Can any man thinke amisse of him, that utters from time to time, such gracious wordes as these? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>darkenesse</hi> doth not thinke amisse of him. Well: but I must take spade and shovell in hand, and to worke againe: Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath laid a new <hi>dunghill</hi> before my <hi>dore,</hi> and I am sure that he that layd it, will not remove it, therefore I my selfe must. The first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and <hi>impudent lye</hi> (which he makes the top or head of this <hi>dunghill</hi>) is, that I affirme it, to be a strange and harsh <hi>expression,</hi> to expresse the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> by saying that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to men for <hi>righteousnes.</hi> Suppose it be a mistake▪ to call it a strange and harsh <hi>expression,</hi> it is farre from being a manifest, and furthest of all, from being an <hi>impudent lye,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (surely) is mistaken in the poynt of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49424:49"/> here: it is not the lye, but the <hi>slaunder</hi> that is <hi>impudent.</hi> But how doth hee prove it to be so much as a mistake, or <hi>untruth,</hi> that such an <hi>expression</hi> would <q>be strange and harsh, to carrie that sence, which hee is resolved to force upon it? His <hi>demonstrative proofe</hi> is this, because it is no strange or harsh <hi>expression,</hi> to use a <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>speech:</hi> and by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> to meane the state, or a man in the state of a true <hi>beleever,</hi> and by <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> the state, or a man in the state of <hi>righteousnes &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> ordinary <hi>Readers</hi> had need have an <hi>Oedipus</hi> still at hand,</q> to find out the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigma's</hi> of his proofes and <hi>arguments:</hi> for poore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vusses</hi> have much adoe to understand any thing. It is true, there are many <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> which are no strange or harsh <hi>expressions:</hi> but first there are few plain and direct <hi>expressions</hi> (as we have proved this to bee) which will not bee made strange and harsh, if men will <hi>metamorphose</hi> them into <hi>metalepticall</hi> and <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> as the sweetest <hi>wine</hi> changed, becomes the sharpest <hi>vinegar.</hi> Secondly, if men will take upon them to coyne new formes of <hi>speaking,</hi> and will call these, <hi>figures,</hi> these may well be strange and harsh <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi>
                  <q>which is Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> beloved <hi>enterprise</hi> in this place. He saith and affirmeth, that by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,</hi> to meane the state, or a man in the state of a true <hi>beleever,</hi> is no strange or harsh <hi>expression.</hi>
                  </q> I would therefore aske him, whether this would not bee a very strange and harsh <hi>expression,</hi> to say that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>iustified</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> his meaning being onely this, that a <hi>beleever</hi> is <hi>iustified</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> And yet by the rules of his <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> it should bee but a <hi>Divine figure</hi> of <hi>speech.</hi> So againe, whether to say that <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> is a member of the <hi>mysticall</hi> body of <hi>Christ,</hi> meaning, that a <hi>righteous</hi> person is such, would not be a strange and harsh <hi>expression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe suppose it bee granted, that sometimes the <hi>abstract</hi> or simple <hi>forme,</hi> may be used for the concrete,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49424:49"/> as <hi>righteousnes,</hi> for <hi>righteous,</hi> or <hi>justified</hi> persons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. so <hi>circumcision,</hi> for <hi>circumcised, Philip. 3. 3.

               </p>
               <p>Yet again: neither will Mr. <hi>Ws. metalepticall oyle,</hi> at all mollifie or smooth the harshnesse of the <hi>Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression Rom.</hi> 4. 3. (though it bee anoynted therewith) if this <hi>interpretation</hi> be put upon it. <hi>Abraham beleeved God</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>) and it (that is, this his <hi>beleeving God,</hi> that is, saith Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> his state of <hi>beleeving,</hi> or the <hi>beleever</hi> himselfe) was <hi>imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> that is, for the state of a <hi>righteous</hi> man.

                  </q> that is,
<q>
                     <l>Who in my selfe shall seeke mee, hardly he</l>
                     <l>shall in my selfe, like to my selfe, e're find me.</l>

               <p>I appeale to all eares that have not quite lost their <hi>palate</hi> and <hi>taste,</hi> whether any <hi>expression</hi> can (lightly) be more <hi>strange, harsh,</hi> and <hi>uncouth,</hi> then that which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath put upon the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this place. Thus you see the first <hi>manifest impudent lie</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> elegantly phraseth it) is neither <hi>lie</hi> nor <hi>impudent:</hi> but onely <hi>manifest,</hi> and that, a <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A second <hi>impudent lie</hi> (like the former) is, that I say that this <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>speech, (viz.</hi> wherewith Mr. <hi>W.</hi> adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as he thinkes: deformeth, as I thinke, these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the <hi>Apostle</hi>)</q> is not to be found in all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles writings.</hi> He should have done well first to have found it, and then it had bin more tolerable to have called it a <hi>lie,</hi> in him that had denied it. But to call it a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest</hi> and <hi>impudent lie,</hi> there had beene small reason howsoever: because Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himselfe, who pretends
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49424:50"/> to finde it, pretends to find it onely in the utmost corner or nooke of one onely <hi>chapter, Rom.</hi> 2. and the foure last <hi>verses.</hi> But what <hi>non-sensicall work</hi> hee makes with, how he figures and misfigures those passages, we have sufficiently acquainted the <hi>Reader</hi> from his owne pen formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The third bold lie, and manifest falshood</hi> is, that the</q>
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> time after time useth the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving imputed &amp;c.</hi> without ever explaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or changing his <hi>speech.</hi> Well: how doth he prove his <hi>substantives</hi> (for he takes it for granted, it seemes, that his <hi>Epithetes</hi> must bee abated him in his proofes) how doth he prove either <hi>lie</hi> or <hi>falshood</hi> simply, in such an <hi>affirmation?</hi> yes, ue produceth the 6. and 11. <hi>ver.</hi> of this chapter, where it is said, that <hi>God imputeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> and that <hi>righteousnes</hi> is <hi>imputed.</hi> Hee might as well have brought forth his letters of <hi>Orders,</hi> or his <hi>licence</hi> to preach, and made them his proofe. For these <hi>phrases</hi> speake not of <hi>Faith:</hi> and how then should they explaine the <hi>imputation</hi> of it? <q>yes that which he calleth <hi>Faith</hi> (saith he) <hi>verse</hi> 3. and 5. say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, that it is <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> here hee explaining himselfe, and changing his <hi>speech,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>righteousnes.</hi> But (good Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) what doth he call <hi>righteousnes,</hi> here?</q> that which hee called <hi>Faith</hi> before, <hi>verse</hi> 3. and 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why not rather that which he called <hi>righteousnes</hi> before? As for example, where he saith, <hi>verse</hi> 13. that the <hi>promise</hi> was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to his <hi>seed,</hi> by the <hi>Law:</hi> why should I rather, by the word <hi>Abraham</hi> in this place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>David,</hi> mentioned <hi>verse</hi> 6. then that very <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> spoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. 3: So by the word <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, verse</hi> 6. and 11. why should I rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Faith,</hi> which is said to be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, verse</hi> 3. and 5. then that <hi>righteousnes</hi> it selfe, for (or unto which) <hi>Faith</hi> is there said to be <hi>imputed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, let Mr. <hi>VVs.</hi> reason-lesse <hi>supposition</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49424:50"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>righteousnes</hi> in these places, the <hi>Apostle</hi> meaneth <hi>Faith,</hi> see what a faire market he hath brought his <hi>hogges</hi> unto. Vpon this <hi>supposition,</hi> when the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>that God imputeth righteousnes to him that beleeveth,</hi> the meaning must be, that <hi>God imputeth Faith</hi> to him that <hi>beleeveth,</hi> and so it will bee so farre from being an explaining of himselfe in his former <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> that it will rather obscure what he had directly and plainely said before. But concerning the true <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> and meaning of this <hi>phrase, imputing righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> wee have discussed it before: where wee found Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> sitting, quite beside the Cushion.

The <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> differ <hi>toto genere</hi> And suppose it had beene said, that the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> had bin made <hi>righteousnes</hi> to us, or our <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> (which yet are <hi>expressions</hi> that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> know not) yet would it not follow, that the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> must needs be ours, as our <hi>Faith</hi> is ours. The other <hi>Scripture</hi> turnes the back upon his purpose, after the same manner. It is onely here said, that <hi>beleevers are made the righteousnes of God in Christ:</hi> that is, the <hi>iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> ones of <hi>God,</hi> by meanes of <hi>Christ,</hi> their great <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering,</hi> and <hi>attonement.</hi> Here is nothing spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> made formally ours by <hi>imputation;</hi> but onely our <hi>iustification</hi> meritoriously wrought, and purchased by him, signified.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But secondly he answeres, that this <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>beleevers,</hi> in order of <hi>nature,</hi> before it be <hi>counted</hi> (or <hi>imputed</hi>) for <hi>righteousnes</hi> unto him. And this hee proves with this left-handed <hi>argument,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49424:51"/> that <hi>GOD,</hi> whose <hi>judgement</hi> is according to truth, doth not <hi>count</hi> that to the <hi>beleever,</hi> which he hath not before, or at the same time doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him. What is this but that poore trick in <hi>Logick,</hi>
                  </q> which they call <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Question, right up and downe. He proves the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>beleevers,</hi> before it be <hi>imputed</hi> to him, because <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>impute</hi> that to him, which he hath not before: where hee takes that for granted which is the <hi>Cardo controversiae, viz.</hi> that <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>impute</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (in his sence) to a <hi>beleever.</hi> And then againe, here is nothing but <hi>Idem per idem,</hi> the same thing prov'd by it selfe, (upon the matter) he proves the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to be a <hi>beleevers,</hi> before it is <hi>imputed,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>impute</hi> it, before it be his. Which is as if he should say: the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>beleevers,</hi> before it be <hi>imputed,</hi> because, before it be his, <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>impute</hi> it. But the <hi>positive</hi> strength of it is even as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as the <hi>relative:</hi> neither is there more <hi>truth,</hi> then dependance in it. For if the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> bee the <hi>beleevers,</hi> before the <hi>imputation,</hi> to what purpose is the <hi>imputation</hi> at all? whereof there can be no other reason given, but onely the making that a <hi>beleevers,</hi> which was not his before. And Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> himselfe had told us before, <hi>page</hi> 30. of his <hi>discourse,</hi> that we are not <hi>iustified</hi> by the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it is his, but as it is ours: which ever and anon he affirmeth to be, by <hi>communication</hi> or <hi>imputation.</hi> Besides if the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>beleevers,</hi> before it be <hi>imputed</hi> then doth not <hi>justification</hi> stand in the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> but is complete before and without it: for he, whose the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is, is (doubtlesse) a <hi>iustified</hi> person.</p>
               <p>Concerning that which he calls his second <hi>Answere,</hi> more then an <hi>Answere</hi> hath beene given to it formerly.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Answere</hi> to my third <hi>Argument,</hi> hee gently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49424:52"/> censures my ignorance in <hi>Rhetoricall tropes,</hi> and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observes my vaine <hi>tergiversation,</hi> and ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceites, that an <hi>argument</hi> might be fram'd out of the third <hi>verse</hi> strong against mee. Well: let us pause a while upon these: the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as are somewhat lower and lesse growne then they were. My <hi>argument</hi> here is: that the <hi>obiect</hi> of that <hi>faith,</hi> which is here said to bee <hi>imputed,</hi> is <hi>God</hi> himselfe, or the <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> for to conceive, that by <hi>God,</hi> is meant the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is to set up a <hi>trope,</hi> which is not a <hi>figure,</hi> but a monster of speech. How now doth Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> answere this, and prove that by <hi>God,</hi> is here meant the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that by a <hi>Rhetoricall trope,</hi> without any strangenesse, or <hi>monstrousnes</hi> of speech? If he had not a good Friend indeed of the <hi>figure Metalepsis,</hi> which like a sure pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse in his teame, will never faile him at a dead pull, he could never have driven the way hee hath gone, thus farre, and (<hi>doubtlesse</hi>) would have beene fast in this slow, (how ever yet he recovers himselfe.) But by vertue of this <hi>benigne figure,</hi> he can make <hi>Mercuries</hi> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any wood, and make plaine, nay <hi>elegant</hi> and <hi>gracefull</hi> speech, of such <hi>phrases</hi> and <hi>expressions</hi> as would astonish <hi>William Lilie,</hi> and put <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> halfe besides their <hi>Rhetoricall</hi> witts. But let us see what <hi>Metalepsis,</hi> and he can doe together, to cleere the businesse in question. He proves, that by <hi>God,</hi> who was here the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Abrahams Faith</hi> (for, he <hi>beleeved God:</hi> and that, it was <hi>imputed</hi> unto him for <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>) is to bee understood the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> thus: <q>because no man in <hi>beleeving</hi> by a true <hi>faith</hi> can separate <hi>Christs satisfaction</hi> and <hi>righteousnes</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: If he enjoyes <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes his <hi>benefits</hi> also <hi>&amp;c. Dicite Io Paean:</hi> Strike up a triumph.</q> Because a man cannot in <hi>beleeving</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> therefore by the word <hi>God,</hi> must necessarily bee understood the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49424:52"/>
                  <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> But first I mervaile why Mr. <hi>W.</hi> throughout this whole discourse, still mentions the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I never to this day, so much as thought of, or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the least difference, or dispute about the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but onely about his active <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> whether this bee so <hi>imputed</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> that by vertue of this <hi>imputation,</hi> hee may claime <hi>Heaven</hi> in right of the first <hi>Covenant, doe this and live,</hi> that is, whether a <hi>beleever</hi> bee formally <hi>righteous</hi> with <hi>Christs righteousnes imputed,</hi> or no: Therefore his <hi>importune</hi> mention, and thrusting in the <hi>passive obedience</hi> or <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> from place to place, without any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or necessity, can argue nothing else, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate desire, to represent mee to the world, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy or denyer of <hi>Christs satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But secondly, what though a man cannot separate the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe in <hi>beleeving?</hi> doth it therefore follow, that the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> must needs be the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>justifying?</hi> much lesse doth it follow, that this <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> must needs be signified, either by the <hi>word, God,</hi> or by the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of <hi>God</hi> concerning <hi>Christ</hi> (which himselfe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have beene the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Abrahams Faith</hi> in this place.) A man cannot separate the soule of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the members of his humane body; from <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in <hi>beleeving:</hi> yet neither the soule of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor any member of his body is the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Faith, as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</hi> For then whosoever <hi>beleeved Christ</hi> had a soule, or a head, hands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be <hi>justified.</hi> Besides, it is not altogether so true (as perhaps he thinks it is) that the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> cannot be separated from <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, <hi>in beleeving,</hi> at least from <hi>Christ</hi> considered, as the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>justifying faith.</hi> The <hi>Turkes</hi> at this day <hi>beleeve Christ</hi> to have beene a <hi>righteous man,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>beleeve</hi> his <hi>righteousnes:</hi> yet doe they not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, <hi>justifyingly.</hi>

               <p>As for that which followeth in the remainder of his <q>answere to this <hi>argument, &amp;c.</hi> as his charge of vaine <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation,</hi> of bringing <hi>Scriptures</hi> to confute my selfe</q> with the rest, I conceive them to bee of that manifest <hi>inconsequence</hi> and <hi>indigestednesse,</hi> that I had rather trust my <hi>Reader</hi> with his owne apprehensions concerning them, then adventure to trouble him with any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.

               <p>My fift <hi>Argument</hi> was: <hi>Abrahams Faith,</hi> which was <hi>imputed</hi> to him, was such a <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein hee was not weake, neither doubted of <hi>Gods promise &amp;c. ver.</hi> 19.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49424:53"/> 20. This can be no description of the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ. Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>How are we beaten out of this field? with this wodden dagger: The more strong <hi>Abraham</hi> was in <hi>Faith &amp;c.</hi> the more firmely he was <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and had more full <hi>communion</hi> of his <hi>righteousnes &amp;c.</hi> therefore this <hi>argument</hi> makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me.</q> I think (indeed) the <hi>argument,</hi> as much as the <hi>Answere,</hi> and both alike. The <hi>Question</hi> is not, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>righteousnes,</hi> or no, either more full or lesse full: but whether that which is here spoken and affirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abrahams faith,</hi> can with any possible congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie of <hi>speech,</hi> be applyed to the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and be conceived, as spoken of that. Was that <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> doubted not of <hi>Gods promise,</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> or rather was not the <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> doubted not of <hi>Christs righteousnes?</hi> But my <hi>Antagonist</hi> starts one new <hi>notion</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> which I doe not remember that I have met with all either from the pen or mouth of any <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> hitherto. <hi>viz.</hi> degrees in <hi>justification.</hi> For that <hi>expression, communion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is still used to signifie <hi>justification:</hi> and therefore if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> by meanes of the strength of his <hi>Faith,</hi> had fuller <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>righteousnes,</hi> then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>beleevers</hi> have, hee must needs bee more <hi>justified</hi> then they: and consequently their <hi>justification</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> must be imperfect.</p>
               <p>My next <hi>argument</hi> he turnes over with the same wet finger. The <hi>argument</hi> was this: <hi>Abrahams beleeving,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> who had <hi>promised,</hi> was able to performe, was the <hi>Faith imputed</hi> to him. But this was not <hi>Christs righteousnes. Ergo.</hi>
                  <q>This Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> confuteth (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmeth) by this <hi>Answere:</hi> The more that <hi>Abraham</hi> rested on <hi>Gods</hi> power <hi>&amp;c</hi> The more <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> he had of <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> and the more justly did <hi>God count</hi> him for a <hi>righteous</hi> man, and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49424:54"/> Christs righteousnes</hi> unto him.</q> I thought to have turn'd <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Answere</hi> loose together; and to have suffered them, each to stand, or fall, by their owne strength, without bringing in any second to um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: but that there is an ill sounding <hi>phrase</hi> or two in the <hi>answere,</hi> which (at best) deserve rods, if not <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</hi> Besides the <hi>repetition</hi> of that <hi>expression,</hi> censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and that for no good) in the former <hi>answere,</hi> hee <q>useth such streyns as these, that the more <hi>Abraham</hi> rested on <hi>Gods</hi> power,</q> the MORE JVSTLY did <hi>God count</hi> him a <hi>righteous man,</hi> and <hi>impute Christs righteousnes</hi> to him. Which let <hi>Charity</hi> her selfe be the <hi>interpres,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but imply, that <hi>God</hi> doth with lesse <hi>justice count a weak beleever, a righteous man,</hi> and with lesse <hi>iustice impute</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> unto him, then to a strong. I know if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had me thus upon the hipp, I should bee violently throwne upon my back, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when I were downe, with the fist of lies, <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, blasphemy &amp;c.</hi> but I will let him gently downe and onely advise him betweene him and mee, to speake more advisedly and considerately hereafter.</p>
               <p>My next <hi>Argument</hi> is: That <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>God imputes</hi> to us for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is said to bee, our <hi>beleeving</hi> on him which rais'd <hi>Christ</hi> from the <hi>dead.</hi> But the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not our <hi>beleeving</hi> on him which rais'd <hi>Christ</hi> from the <hi>dead. Ergò.</hi> How doth Mr. <hi>W.</hi> fence this blow? <hi>Crimine ab uno-Disce omnes:</hi> Hee that one <hi>Answere</hi> hath of his, hath all. I cannot properly say that which hee answereth, but that which hee here saith, is this: our <hi>beleeving</hi>
                  <q>in <hi>God</hi> who raised <hi>Christ</hi> from the dead, is our assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that <hi>Christ</hi> hath made full <hi>satisfaction</hi> for us, and therefore the <hi>righteous, God,</hi> who raised him up, is <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> for us, and hath accepted his <hi>righteousnes</hi> for our <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concluding thus. Therefore this is for us, and not against us.</q> Surely a Shoomak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might as well sell Scabberds for Shooes, as Scholars
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49424:54"/> put off Arguments with such <hi>impertinent discourses</hi> as these, instead of <hi>Answers;</hi> For what is there in all this to prove (or so much as to colour over a proofe) that by that <hi>Faith</hi> which is described to be our <hi>beleeving</hi> on him that raised <hi>Christ</hi> from the dead, must needs be meant the <hi>righteousnes,</hi> or <hi>active obedience of Christ?</hi> or what reasonable man is there under Heaven, that can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Apostle intending to describe the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> should describe it thus: <hi>The righteousnes of Christ is our beleeving on him, that raised up Christ from the dead.</hi> This is the <hi>quintessence</hi> &amp; <hi>extract</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ws. answer.</hi>
               </p>

                  </q> Indeed if this were my <hi>Argument,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> Answer would serve. The summe of my <hi>Argument,</hi> (more at large opened in my papers) is this, The <hi>point</hi> or <hi>question</hi> of <hi>imputation</hi> in <hi>iustification,</hi> being onely handled in this passage of Scripture, and no where else <hi>explained;</hi> it is no waies probable, but that the Apostle should speake somewhat <hi>distinctly,</hi> and <hi>plainely,</hi> of the nature of it: otherwise he might seeme rather desirous to lay a stumbling in the way, then to write any thing for the learning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp;c.

Sure I am, that <hi>Paul</hi> built upon <hi>Faith,</hi> for his <hi>iustification,</hi> as well as on the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe (as Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> beloved <hi>phrase</hi> is) though in a different manner, (which hath been formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) when he said: We know that a man is not <hi>iustified</hi> by the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but by the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> and have <hi>beleeved</hi> in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that we might be <hi>iustified</hi> by the <hi>faith of Christ, &amp;c. Gal.</hi> 2. 16. And as <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh concerning himselfe, <hi>Iohn 12. 44. He that beleeveth in me, beleeveth not in me, but in him that sent me:</hi> that is, not so much in me, as in him that sent me: So may it be sayd, that he that buildeth on <hi>faith,</hi> buildeth not on <hi>faith,</hi> but on the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes</hi> of him, who hath promised forgivenesse of sinnes and <hi>salvation</hi> to him that <hi>beleeveth.</hi> And for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or stayning of <hi>faith</hi> with many doubtings this is no consideration at all, to deferre or keepe a man from building upon it, if it be a <hi>faith</hi> unfeigned and true: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is the same <hi>iustification</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the weakest <hi>faith,</hi> and to the strongest.</p>

I will not be so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to my Reader here, as to relate the passage hee strikes at: there are some copies thereof, in some mens hands, and more (I conceive) may be taken upon this occasion, but the substance of the <hi>answere</hi> he gives to this passage, consists (chiefly) of 2 or 3 untruths. As first, where he saith, that especially the act of <hi>belieefe</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> are to be understood, <hi>Gal. 1. 22 &amp; 3. 23. Col. 1. 5. Cujus contrarium verum est.</hi> 2. where he saith that he hath prov'd the <hi>righteousnes or active obedience of Christ,</hi> to be the object of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>justifying:</hi> whereas he hath not in all his <hi>discourse,</hi> made the least haire of that head, either black or white. 3. (and lastly) where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes this <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be the onely <hi>proper object</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>iustifying:</hi> whereas it hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctingly <hi>demonstrated,</hi> that it is neither the <hi>proper,</hi> nor lesse <hi>proper obiect</hi> thereof, as such, and also that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> no where speake so of it. And yet as the <hi>Israelites</hi> when they had made their golden <hi>Calfe,</hi> were not <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> therewith, but rejoyced over the work of their owne hands, and <hi>eate</hi> and <hi>drank</hi> and <hi>played before it.</hi> So neither doth this man content himselfe, to speake his pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The reason (I conceive) why he could think no better of that my <hi>Confession,</hi> then to be made out of <hi>subtiltie,</hi> was the faultinesse of the Standerd in his owne bosome.</p>

                  </q> but here we have a <hi>Lernaean</hi> Lake of <hi>hideous</hi> and <hi>portentous Divinity,</hi> things which I should have conceived, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would not have <hi>received</hi>

               <p>First he affirmes the taking away of <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by the <hi>active obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> onely: whereas the <hi>Scriptures</hi> teach expressely, that without shedding of <hi>blood, there is no remission. (Heb.</hi> 9. 22.) neither of <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>commission</hi> nor of <hi>omission.</hi> So 1 <hi>Ioh. 1. 7. The bloud of Iesus Christ his Sonne, cleanseth us from</hi> ALL <hi>sinne:</hi> not of <hi>commission</hi> onely, but of <hi>omission</hi> also. Againe, <hi>Rev. 1. 5. Vnto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his bloud.</hi> So <hi>Rom. 4. 25. who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd to death for our sins &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Scripture never</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth any purging or taking away of <hi>sinne,</hi> but by the <hi>blood, death</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> neither doth it give the least intimation of any distinction or <hi>difference</hi> to be made (in this respect) betweene <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>omission,</hi> and <hi>commission.</hi> Neither is there any colour or <hi>appearance</hi> of difference betweene them, in <hi>reference</hi> to their <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> and <hi>attonement,</hi> there being many <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which are much more heynons and grievous, then many <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he makes the <hi>active obedience</hi> or <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> life, of like consideration, with his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>passive obedience, viz. penall</hi> and <hi>satisfactory:</hi> as if to live <hi>righteously</hi> and <hi>holily,</hi> had bin a <hi>punishment</hi> layd upon <hi>Christ,</hi> to make <hi>satisfaction</hi> for all the <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> whereas himselfe affirmeth, that it was his meate, (not his <hi>punishment) to doe the will of him that sent him. Iohn</hi> 4. 34. The <hi>Papists</hi> indeed make prayer, and other their <hi>serving God, penall</hi> and <hi>satisfactory:</hi> but (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov. 21. 15,) It is ioy to the iust to do iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Iob that he put on righteousnes and it covered him, and iudgement was a robe and Diademe unto him, Iob.</hi> 29. So generally when the heart is renued by <hi>grace,</hi> and brought to an inward and habituall <hi>conformity</hi> with the Law of <hi>God,</hi> wayes of <hi>righteousnes</hi> and <hi>holines,</hi> are wayes of <hi>pleasure,</hi> and of intire contentment. Much more then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49424:58"/> must it needs be conceived; that the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> being full of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and having the <hi>Spirit</hi> without measure (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> witnesseth) and not the least <hi>reluctation</hi> in the frame of his Heart and soule against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>holy Commadement</hi> or way of <hi>God,</hi> tooke very high and rich contentment, in all those wayes of <hi>holinesse,</hi> wherein hee walked, and exercised himselfe all his dayes: yet is it not denyed in all this, but that this <hi>active obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> may in some <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>respect,</hi> be called <hi>satisfactory</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> as concurring and falling in with its <hi>influence</hi> into the <hi>bloud</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but not in and by it selfe. And this our <hi>Saviour</hi> himselfe teacheth, <hi>Iohn 12. 24. Except the corne of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:</hi> that is, <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>active obedience,</hi> and the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of his life, had <hi>iustified</hi> none but himselfe, without his death: but if it dye, (saith hee) <hi>it bringeth forth much fruit,</hi> that is, so <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> a person as <hi>Christ</hi> was in his life, by his <hi>death iustifieth</hi> many. Hence it is, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> so frequently when they mention the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the <hi>redemption,</hi> or <hi>expiation</hi> of the <hi>sinnes</hi> of men, still mention his <hi>holinesse</hi> or the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of his life with it. <hi>For Christ also hath suffered for sinnes, the IVST for the uniust, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. So 1 <hi>Pet. 1 18. 19. knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, &amp;c. but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lamb undefiled, and without spot:</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. 22. even as those qualifications, of age, Sex, spotlessenes, soundnesse <hi>&amp;c.</hi> required in the <hi>legall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> were <hi>expiatory</hi> (in their kind) when the <hi>Beast</hi> came to be offreed and slaine, but not before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and lastly, and which is of the worst, and indeed of desperate consequence) by dividing the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> into parts, he utterly destroyes and abolisheth the infinitenesse thereof. For that which may be divided, must needs be finite: and that which is but the part of another, cannot it selfe be infinite. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49424:59"/> as certaine it is, that that whose parts are finite, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not it selfe be infinite.

Certainly no <hi>sinne,</hi> nor <hi>sinnes,</hi> can require more then an <hi>infinite satisfaction.</hi> And if this <hi>active satisfaction</hi> be <hi>infinite,</hi> and consequently <hi>sufficient</hi> to take away the <hi>sinnes</hi> of the <hi>world:</hi> what necessitie can there be conceived of the <hi>passive satisfaction,</hi> if the worke and intent thereof be otherwise performed. I <hi>doe not frustrate the grace of God (saith Paul) for if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes be by the Law, then Christ is dead in vaine. Gal.</hi> 2. 21.

               <p>My last labour (in this my Replye) is to vindicate the testimonies, produced by me out of severall <hi>Authors,</hi> as well ancient and moderne, for the further establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirmation, of the <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in a direct and <hi>proper sence,</hi> in those controverted passages of the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> 4.

Or if wee had to do with a man that would stand his ground, and owne his owne <hi>opinion</hi> when it is at the best, this labour might be spared altogether. For Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (as hath beene more then once observed) hath more then

               <p>Howsoever, I shall be very succinct and briefe in my demonstrations, being full of confidence, that every man that is not Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will be very easily satisfied in the point▪ Concerning these testimonies in generall, I desire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound but this one consideration, to any reasonable and considering man: whether it bee so much as tollerably credible, or probable in the least and lowest degree of probability, that so many learned <hi>Interpreters,</hi> one succeeding other thorough so many generations, and undertaking to expound a <hi>Scripture</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be figurative and <hi>tropicall,</hi> nay (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for) <hi>hypertropicall,</hi> where there should bee <hi>figure</hi> upon <hi>figure,</hi> and <hi>trope</hi> upon <hi>trope,</hi> should none of them give warning, or so much as take notice of any <hi>tropicall</hi> expression, but deliver their mindes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the places, in the very same terme, and word, wherein the <hi>trope</hi> upon <hi>trope,</hi> should lye.
<q>Credat Iudaus Apella, Non ego.</q> that is,
<q>
                     <l>This let the circumcised <hi>Iew,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Especially considering that it is the manner of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,</hi> when they came to any <hi>tropicall</hi> and <hi>figurative expression</hi> so conceived and apprehended by them, though the <hi>figure</hi> be ten times more <hi>obvious</hi> (then it can be in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> controverted, if there were any)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49424:60"/> yet either to give notice of the <hi>figure</hi> by Name, or at least to set downe in more plaine and <hi>expresse</hi> words, what is meant by the <hi>figurative</hi> expression in the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> neither of which is done, by any of the <hi>Authors</hi> cited by mee upon those places; but still, that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith was <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Abraham, viz</hi> his <hi>beleeving God,</hi> or his <hi>Faith,</hi> the same say these <hi>interpreters</hi> also: yea some of them <hi>emphatically,</hi> seeking (as it were) to bind their <hi>Reader</hi> to the very word and terme of <hi>Faith,</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> useth, and not suffering them to cast about in their mindes or thoughts, for any other thing. As in the testimony cited from <hi>Bucer: Abraham fidem habuit Iehovae, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnes,</hi> that is (saith <hi>Bucer</hi>) hee <hi>accounted this</hi> FAITH, <hi>or</hi> BELEEVING <hi>to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</hi> If he had ever once imagined, the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to have beene that, which <hi>was imputed to Abraham for righteousnes,</hi> and not <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> in a <hi>proper sence,</hi> would he have expressed himselfe in such a manner? So in that cited from <hi>Bullinger: Concredidit se Abraham Deo &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> committed himselfe unto <hi>God</hi> by <hi>beleeving, &amp; illud ipsum &amp;c.</hi> that is, that VERY SAME THING <hi>was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</hi> He that will here by <hi>illud ipsum,</hi> that VERY SAME THING understand the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> must seeke his <hi>substantive</hi> to his <hi>adjective</hi> hee knowes not where, and when he hath found it, will break poore <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scians</hi> head with it too. Again, in that other <hi>testimony</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the same <hi>Author,</hi> upon <hi>Gal. 3. 6. imputatum est ei &amp;c. hoc est,</hi> ILLA IPSA ABRAHAE FIDES, <hi>ipsi ad justitiam imputatum est,</hi> that is, <hi>it was imputed to him for righteousnes:</hi> that is, this very SELFE SAME FAITH OF ABRAHAM, was <hi>imputed to him for righteousnes.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes bold, to understand by <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (where be pleaseth) yet by the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he will not adventure to understand the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> least hee should sinne against
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49424:60"/> the <hi>reputation</hi> and credit of his owne understanding too farre. In these and sundry other testimonies yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of very reasonable apprehension cannot but conceive, that the <hi>Authors,</hi> with as much <hi>anxiety</hi> and warines of <hi>speech,</hi> as well they could use, excluded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whatsoever, (without exception) from this <hi>imputation,</hi> but onely that VERY SELFE SAME FAITH of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the <hi>proper literall,</hi> and most usuall and <hi>obvious sence</hi> and <hi>signification.</hi> This for the first demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which concerns the <hi>testimonies</hi> in generall, whereby it appeares, through and through all that thick mist of wordes and passion which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to obscure and darken it, that the <hi>Authors</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by me alledged upon these <hi>Scriptures,</hi> did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>word,</hi> FAITH, or BELEEVING, in a <hi>tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> or <hi>metalepticall sence,</hi> for the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but in a <hi>proper,</hi> plaine, and <hi>direct sence,</hi> for that <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> by which <hi>Abraham</hi> through the <hi>worke</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> beleeved in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter demonstration, will not (I take it) extend so far as the former did, to include all the <hi>testimonies</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: but as farre as it will reach, which is to many of them, it makes the matter greater then <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> that their <hi>Authors</hi> in their <hi>commentaries</hi> and <hi>exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> could not possibly take the word <hi>Faith,</hi> or BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEEVING in a <hi>figurative</hi> or <hi>metalepticall sence,</hi> but in a <hi>proper.</hi> The demonstration is this: because the <hi>word</hi> FAITH, taken in a <hi>figurative sence</hi> for the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> will make them speake partly manifest and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>blasphemy,</hi> partly most ridiculously and absurdly: As for example, in that cited from <hi>Luther,</hi> on <hi>Gal. 3. 6.
